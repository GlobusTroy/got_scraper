1,0,0,SCENE,"[First scene opens with three Rangers riding through a tunnel, leaving the Wall, and going into the woods. (Eerie music in background) One Ranger splits off and finds a campsite full of mutilated bodies, including a child hanging from a tree branch. A birds-eye view shows the bodies arranged in a shield-like pattern. The Ranger rides back to the other two.]"
2,0,0,ROYCE,"What d’you expect? They’re savages. One lot steals a goat from another lot and before you know it, they’re ripping each other to pieces."
3,0,0,WILL,"I’ve never seen wildlings do a thing like this. I’ve never seen a thing like this, not ever in my life."
4,0,0,ROYCE,How close did you get?
5,0,0,WILL,Close as any man would.
6,0,0,GARED,We should head back to the wall.
7,0,0,ROYCE,Do the dead frighten you?
8,0,0,GARED,Our orders were to track the wildlings. We tracked them. They won’t trouble us no more.
9,0,0,ROYCE,You don’t think he’ll ask us how they died? Get back on your horse.
10,0,0,SCENE,[GARED grumbles.]
11,0,0,WILL,Whatever did it to them could do it to us. They even killed the children.
12,0,0,ROYCE,"It’s a good thing we’re not children. You want to run away south, run away. Of course, they will behead you as a deserter … If I don’t catch you first. Get back on your horse. I won’t say it again."
13,0,0,SCENE,"[WILL glares, but obeys. Sometime later, the three Rangers return to the campsite, which is now completely cleared.]"
14,0,0,ROYCE,Your dead men seem to have moved camp.
15,0,0,WILL,They were here.
16,0,0,GARED,See where they went.
17,0,0,SCENE,"[The three look around, swords drawn. They hear the wind and eerie calls. GARED finds a red cloth in the snow.]"
18,0,0,ROYCE,What is it?
19,0,0,GARED,It’s …
20,0,0,SCENE,"[As he speaks, a CREATURE with glowing blue eyes rises behind ROYCE. ROYCE turns, the CREATURE strikes. The scene shifts to WILL, who hears a man crying out. The three horses stampede past him. He turns and sees someone standing very still in the distance. The figure turns – it’s the child who had been suspended in the tree, now with glowing blue eyes. WILL turns and runs. GARED is also fleeing, and we hear strange growls and catch glimpses of the CREATURE. Both terrified RANGERS stop, some distance apart, to catch their breath. WILL sees a CREATURE behead GARED. WILL sinks to his knees and the CREATURE tosses GARED’S head to him.]"
21,0,0,SCENE,[Blackout / Opening credits]
22,0,0,SCENE,"[Riders from Winterfell come up behind a dazed WILL. The scene shifts to the castle, where BRAN is practicing archery and getting frustrated, under the eyes of JON SNOW and ROBB STARK. JON pats BRAN’S shoulder.]"

29,0,0,SCENE,"[As she murmurs to SANSA about the embroidery, ARYA struggles with her needlework and listens to the arrows hitting and the male laughter outside.]"
30,0,0,SCENE,"[Outside, BRAN tries and misses again. Everyone laughs.]"
31,0,0,NED,"And which one of you was a marksman at ten? Keep practicing, Bran. Go on."
32,0,0,JON,"Don’t think too much, Bran."
33,0,0,ROBB,Relax your bow arm.
34,0,0,SCENE,"[BRAN pulls the arrow back. An arrow hits the bullseye. BRAN (still with his arrow), JON, and ROBB turn in surprise to see ARYA, who curtsies after her perfect shot. ROBB and JON laugh as Bran takes out after ARYA.]"
35,0,0,ROBB,"Quick, Bran, faster!"
36,0,0,SCENE,[RODRICK CASSEL and THEON GREYJOY approach NED and CATELYN on the balcony.]
37,0,0,CASSEL,Lord Stark. My lady. A guardsman just rode in from the hills. They’ve captured a deserter from the Night’s Watch.

45,0,0,SCENE,[CASSEL nods and departs.]
46,0,0,CATELYN,Ned. Ten is too young to see such things.
47,0,0,NED,He won’t be a boy forever. And winter is coming.
48,0,0,SCENE,"[NED departs. In the courtyard, ROBB and JON gather the arrows. CATELYN turns and glares down on JON. He looks at her and walks away.]"
49,0,0,ROBB,"Lad, go run back and get the rest."
50,0,0,SCENE,"[Scene shifts, and we see WILL being taken to the block.] WILL (muttering): White Walkers. I saw the White Walkers. White Walkers. The White Walkers, I saw them."
51,0,0,SCENE,[He and NED face each other.]
52,0,0,WILL,"I know I broke my oath. And I know I’m a deserter. I should have gone back to the Wall and warned them. But I saw what I saw. I saw the White Walkers. People need to know. If you can get word to my family, tell them I’m no coward. Tell them I’m sorry. NED nods yes, and WILL is positioned on the tree limb that serves as a block. [NED draws Ice from a scabbard held by Theon.] WILL (whispering): Forgive me, lord."
53,0,0,SCENE,[NED bows his head over ICE.]
54,0,0,NED,"In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, first of his name … JON (to BRAN): Don’t look away."
55,0,0,NED,King of the Andals and the First Men …
56,0,0,JON,Father will know if you do.
57,0,0,NED,"Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and protector of the realm, I, Eddard of the House Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North, sentence you to die."
58,0,0,SCENE,[NED swings ICE and beheads WILL. BRAN does not look away.]
59,0,0,JON,You did well.
60,0,0,SCENE,[He walks away. ROBB turns and puts his arm around BRAN and they go to their horses together. NED approaches BRAN.]
61,0,0,NED,You understand why I did it?
62,0,0,BRAN,Jon said he was a deserter.
63,0,0,NED,But do you understand why I had to kill him?
64,0,0,BRAN,Our way is the old way?
65,0,0,NED,The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword.
66,0,0,BRAN,Is it true he saw the White Walkers?
67,0,0,NED,The White Walkers have been gone for thousands of years.
68,0,0,BRAN,So he was lying?
69,0,0,NED,A madman sees what he sees.

72,0,0,THEON,Mountain lion?
73,0,0,NED,There are no mountain lions in these woods.
74,0,0,SCENE,"[ With swords out, they begin to search. NED finds a dead direwolf with antlers through her throat. Her pups are whimpering around her.]"
75,0,0,THEON,It’s a freak.
76,0,0,NED,It’s a direwolf.
77,0,0,SCENE,[NED and CASSEL glance at each other.]
78,0,0,NED,Tough old beast.

81,0,0,JON,Now there are five.
82,0,0,SCENE,[Jon picks up a pup and offers it to BRAN.]

84,0,0,BRAN,Where will they go? Their mother’s dead.
85,0,0,CASSEL,They don’t belong down here.
86,0,0,NED,Better a quick death. They won’t last without their mother.
87,0,0,THEON,Right. Give it here.

89,0,0,THEON,"I take orders from your father, not you."
90,0,0,BRAN,"Please, father!"
91,0,0,NED,"I’m sorry, Bran."

102,0,0,JAIME,"As your brother, I feel it’s my duty to warn you: You worry too much. It’s starting to show."
103,0,0,CERSEI,"And you never worry about anything. When we were seven, you jumped off the cliffs as Casterly Rock. One hundred foot drop into the water. And you were never afraid."
104,0,0,JAIME,"There was nothing to be afraid of until you told father. [In a whisper, mimicking] We’re Lannisters. Lannisters don’t act like fools."
105,0,0,CERSEI,What if Jon Arryn told someone?
106,0,0,JAIME,But who would he tell?
107,0,0,CERSEI,My husband.
108,0,0,JAIME,"If he told the king, both our heads would be skewered on the city gates by now. Whatever Jon Arryn knew or didn’t know, it died with him. And Robert will choose a new Hand of the king, someone to do his job while he’s off fucking boars and hunting whores. Or is it the other way around? And life will go on."
109,0,0,CERSEI,You should be the Hand of the king.
110,0,0,JAIME,"That’s an honor I can do without. Their days are too long, their lives are too short. Scene shifts to a raven approaching Winterfell. [CATELYN crosses a busy courtyard and finds NED in the godswood.]"
111,0,0,CATELYN,All these years and I still feel like an outsider when I come here.
112,0,0,NED,You have five northern children. You’re not an outsider.
113,0,0,CATELYN,I wonder if the old gods agree.
114,0,0,NED,It’s your gods with all the rules.
115,0,0,CATELYN,"I am so sorry, my love."
116,0,0,NED,Tell me.
117,0,0,CATELYN,There was a raven from Kings Landing. Jon Arryn is dead. A fever took him. I know he was like a father to you.
118,0,0,NED,Your sister. The boy …
119,0,0,CATELYN,They both have their health. Gods be good. [pause] The raven brought more news. The king rides for Winterfell. With the queen and all the rest of them.
120,0,0,NED,"He’s coming this far North, there’s only one thing he’s after."
121,0,0,CATELYN,"You can always say no, Ned."
122,0,0,SCENE,[Scene shifts to the Winterfell great hall where a great banquet is being prepared.]

124,0,0,LUWIN,I’m told he drinks all night.
125,0,0,CATELYN,How much could he possibly drink? A man of his … stature.
126,0,0,LUWIN,We’ve brought up eight barrels of ale from the cellar. Perhaps we’ll find out.
127,0,0,CATELYN,"In any case, candles."
128,0,0,SCENE,"[Scene shifts to Robb, Theon, and Jon getting barbered.]"
129,0,0,JON,Why’s your mother so dead-set on us getting pretty for the king?
130,0,0,THEON,"It’s for the queen, I bet. I hear she’s [sleek as a mink?]"
131,0,0,ROBB,I hear the prince is a right royal prick.
132,0,0,THEON,Think of all those southern girls he gets to stab with his right royal prick.
133,0,0,ROBB,"Go on, Tommy, shave him good. He’s never met a girl he likes better than his own hair."
134,0,0,SCENE,"[Scene shifts to the royal procession approaching Winterfell. Bran sees them from his perch high atop a castle wall and clambers nimbly down to tell everyone. CATELYN and LUWIN walk to the courtyard, passing BRAN’s wolf pup.]"
135,0,0,CATELYN,"Gods, but they grow fast. [Seeing BRAN on the wall] Brandon!"
136,0,0,BRAN,I saw the king! He’s got hundreds of people!
137,0,0,CATELYN,How many times have I told you: No climbing!
138,0,0,BRAN,But he’s coming right now! Down our road!
139,0,0,CATELYN,I want you to promise me: No more climbing. BRAN (looking down): I promise.
140,0,0,CATELYN,D’you know what?
141,0,0,BRAN,What?
142,0,0,CATELYN,You always look at your feet before you lie. Run and find your father. Tell him the king is close.
143,0,0,SCENE,"[BRAN runs off, followed by his wolf pup.]"
144,0,0,SCENE,"[Scene shifts to grand entry of the king’s horses and men. ARYA, wearing a helm and cloak, pushes her way into a tall wagon for a better look. In rides JOFFREY, followed by the HOUND . The other Starks wait in a greeting line.]"
145,0,0,CATELYN,"Where’s Arya? Sansa, where’s your sister?"
146,0,0,SCENE,[More riders with banners. ARYA scoots past her parents to get in the receiving line.]
147,0,0,NED,"Hey,, hey, hey, hey. What are you doing with that on? [Pulls off ARYA’s helm] ARYA (pushing BRAN): Move!"
148,0,0,SCENE,"[JOFFREY rides up, SANSA smiles at him, ROBB glares at JOFFREY. The HOUND pulls up his helm. The coach carrying CERSEI lumbers in, followed by KING ROBERT. All kneel. ROBERT heaves himself off his horse. NED looks shocked at the sight of his old friend, now fat and red-faced. ROBERT signals for all to rise and looks at NED.]"
149,0,0,NED,Your Grace.
150,0,0,ROBERT,You’ve got fat.
151,0,0,SCENE,[NED gives ROBERT a “What about you?” look. They start laughing.]
152,0,0,ROBERT,Cat!
153,0,0,CATELYN,Your Grace.
154,0,0,ROBERT,Nine years. Why haven’t I seen you? Where the hell have you been?
155,0,0,NED,"Guarding the North for you, Your Grace. Winterfell is yours."
156,0,0,SCENE,[CERSEI and her other children descend from the coach.]
157,0,0,ARYA,Where’s the Imp?
158,0,0,SANSA,Will you shut up?
159,0,0,ROBERT,"Who have we here? You must be Robb. (To Sansa) My, you’re a pretty one. (To Arya) Your name is?"
160,0,0,ARYA,Arya. ROBERT (to BRAN) Ooh. Show us your muscles. You’ll be a soldier.
161,0,0,SCENE,[JAIME removes his helm.]
162,0,0,ARYA,That’s Jaime Lannister. The queen’s twin brother.
163,0,0,SANSA,Would you please shut up.
164,0,0,SCENE,[CERSEI approaches.]
165,0,0,NED,My queen.
166,0,0,CATELYN,My queen.
167,0,0,ROBERT,Take me to your crypt. I want to pay my respects.
168,0,0,CERSEI,"We’ve been riding for a month, my love. Surely the dead can wait."
169,0,0,ROBERT,Ned.
170,0,0,ARYA,Where’s the Imp?
171,0,0,SCENE,"[CERSEI, humiliated in front of all, walks back to JAIME.]"
172,0,0,CERSEI,Where is our brother? Go find the little beast.
173,0,0,SCENE,[Scene changes to the crypt.]
174,0,0,NED,Tell me about Jon Arryn.
175,0,0,ROBERT,"One minute he was fine, and then … Burned right through him, whatever it was. I loved that man."
176,0,0,NED,We both did.
177,0,0,ROBERT,"He never had to teach you much, but me … You remember me at 16? All I wanted to do was crack skulls and fuck girls. He showed me what was what."
178,0,0,NED,Aye.
179,0,0,ROBERT,"Don’t look at me like that. Not his fault I didn’t listen. (They laugh. ROBERT sighs.) I need you, Ned. Down at Kings Landing. Not up here, where you’re no damn use to anybody. Lord Eddard Stark, I would name you the Hand of the king."
180,0,0,SCENE,[NED kneels.]
181,0,0,NED,I’m not worthy of the honor.
182,0,0,ROBERT,"I’m not trying to honor you. I’m trying to get you to run my kingdom while I eat, drink, and whore my way to an early grave. Damn it, Ned, stand up. You helped me win the Iron Throne, now help me keep the damn thing. We were meant to rule together. If your sister had lived, we would have been bound by blood. Well, it’s not too late. I have a son, you have a daughter. We’ll join our Houses."
183,0,0,SCENE,"[Scene changes to JAIME in the Winterfell settlement. We see Tyrion inside a whorehouse, swilling liquor and laughing as a woman pops into view after servicing him.]"
184,0,0,TYRION,Mmh. It is true what they say about the Northern girls.
185,0,0,ROS,Did you hear the king’s in Winterfell?
186,0,0,TYRION,I did hear something about that.
187,0,0,ROS,And the queen. And her twin brother. They say that he is the most handsome man in the Seven Kingdoms.
188,0,0,TYRION,And the other brother?
189,0,0,ROS,The queen has two brothers?
190,0,0,TYRION,There’s the pretty one. And there’s the clever one.
191,0,0,ROS,I hear they call him the Imp.
192,0,0,TYRION,I hear he hates that nickname.
193,0,0,ROS,Oh? I hear he’s more than earned it. I hear he’s a drunken little lecher into all manner of perversions.
194,0,0,TYRION,Clever girl.
195,0,0,ROS,"We’ve been expecting you, Lord Tyrion."
196,0,0,TYRION,Have you?
197,0,0,TYRION,The gods gave me one blessing.
198,0,0,SCENE,[She climbs on TYRION. JAIME walks in without knocking.]
199,0,0,JAIME,Don’t get up.
200,0,0,ROS,M’lord.
201,0,0,TYRION,"Should I explain to you the meaning of a closed door in a whorehouse, brother?"
202,0,0,JAIME,"You’ve much to teach me, no doubt. But our sister craves your attention."
203,0,0,TYRION,"She has odd cravings, our sister."
204,0,0,JAIME,"A family trait. Now, the Starks are feasting us at sundown. Don’t leave me alone with these people."
205,0,0,TYRION,"I’m sorry, I’ve begun the feast a bit early. And this is the first of many courses."
206,0,0,JAIME,"I thought you might say that. But since we’re short on time, (he opens the door; a bevy of whores enter and descend on TYRION) Come on, girls. See you at sundown."
207,0,0,SCENE,[JAIME leaves.]
208,0,0,TYRION,Close the door!
209,0,0,SCENE,"[Scene changes to the Winterfell crypt, at Lyanna’s tomb. Robert places a feather in the hand of her statue.]"
210,0,0,ROBERT,Did you have to bury her in a place like this? She should be on a hill somewhere with the sun and the clouds above her.
211,0,0,NED,She was my sister. This is where she belongs.
212,0,0,ROBERT,She belonged with me.
213,0,0,SCENE,[He touches Lyanna’s face.]
214,0,0,ROBERT,"In my dreams, I kill him every night."
215,0,0,NED,"It’s done, Your Grace. The Targaryens are gone."
216,0,0,ROBERT,Not all of them.
217,0,0,SCENE,"[Scene shifts to Daenerys on a balcony in Pentos, across the Narrow Sea.] VISERYS (off camera): Daenerys!"
218,0,0,SCENE,[He enters a large chamber.]
219,0,0,VISERYS,Daenerys! There’s our bride to be! Look – a gift from Illyrio. Touch it. Come on. Feel the fabric. Mmmm. Isn’t he a gracious host?
220,0,0,DAENERYS,We’ve been his guests for over a year and he’s never asked us for anything.
221,0,0,VISERYS,"Illyrio is no fool. He knows I won’t forget my friends when I come into my throne. You still slouch. Let me see. (He pulls off her gown.) You have a woman’s body now. (She endures it as he strokes her breast.) I need you to be perfect today. Can you do that for me? You don’t want to wake the dragon, do you?"
222,0,0,DAENERYS,No.
223,0,0,SCENE,[VISERYS nods and starts to leave the chamber. He turns.]
224,0,0,VISERYS,"When they write the history of my reign, sweet sister, they will say it began today."
225,0,0,SCENE,[Daenerys turns and steps into a steaming hot bath with a despairing look on her face.]
226,0,0,MAID,"It’s too hot, my lady."
227,0,0,SCENE,"[ But DAENERYS keeps stepping deeper. The scene shifts to ILLYRIOS, DAENERYS, AND VISERYS outside the mansion, awaiting Khal Drogo.]"
228,0,0,VISERYS,Where is he?
229,0,0,ILLYRIO,The Dothraki are not known for their punctuality.
230,0,0,SCENE,[A host of Dothraki come riding up. Khal Drogo wheels his stallion into the front.]
231,0,0,ILLYRIO,"(Greets them in Dothraki.) May I present my honored guests? Viserys of House Targaryen, the third of his name. The rightful King of the Andals and the First Men. And his sister, Daenerys, of the House Targaryen. VISERYS (to DAENERYS) Do you see how long his hair is? When Dothraki are defeated in combat, they cut off their braid so the whole world can see their shame. Khal Drogo has never been defeated. He’s a savage, of course, but he’s one of the finest killers alive. And you will be his queen."
232,0,0,ILLYRIO,"Come forward, my dear."
233,0,0,SCENE,"[KHAL DROGO watches as DAENERYS walks toward him. She does not hesitate and looks straight at him, although there is fear on her face. KHAL DROGO gazes at her and then leads his horsemen on a charge away.]"
234,0,0,VISERYS,Where’s he going?
235,0,0,ILLYRIO,The ceremony is over.
236,0,0,VISERYS,But he didn’t say anything. Did he like her?
237,0,0,ILLYRIO,"Trust me, Your Grace. If he didn’t like her, we’d know."
238,0,0,SCENE,"[The scene shifts to ILLYRIO, VISERYS, AND DAENERYS ON A GARDEN BALCONY OVERLOOKING THE SEA.]"
239,0,0,ILLYRIO,It won’t be long now. Soon you will cross the Narrow Sea and take back your father’s throne. The people drink secret toasts to your health. They cry out for their true king.
240,0,0,VISERYS,When will they be married?
241,0,0,ILLYRIO,Soon. The Dothraki never stay still for long.
242,0,0,VISERYS,Is it true they lie with their horses?
243,0,0,ILLYRIO,I wouldn’t ask Khal Drogo.
244,0,0,VISERYS,Do you take me for a fool?
245,0,0,ILLYRIO,I take you for a king. Kings lack the caution of common men. My apologies if I’ve given offense.
246,0,0,VISERYS,I know how to play a man like Drogo. I give him a queen and he gives me an army. DAENERYS (pleadingly) I don’t want to be his queen. I want to go home.
247,0,0,VISERYS,"So do I. I want us both to go home. But they took it from us. So tell me, sweet sister, how do we go home?"
248,0,0,DAENERYS,I don’t know.
249,0,0,VISERYS,"We go home with an army. With Khal Drogo’s army. I would let his whole tribe fuck you, all 40,000 men and their horses too, if that’s what it took."
250,0,0,SCENE,"[He gives DAENERYS a brotherly kiss on the forehead and walks away. The scene shifts to a bedroom in Winterfell, where CATELYN is fixing SANSA’S hair.]"
251,0,0,SANSA,Do you think Joffrey will like me? What if he thinks I’m ugly?
252,0,0,CATELYN,Then he is the stupidest prince that ever lived.
253,0,0,SANSA,He’s so handsome.
254,0,0,SCENE,[CATELYN rolls her eyes.]
255,0,0,SANSA,When would we be married? Soon or do we have to wait?
256,0,0,CATELYN,Hush now. Your father hasn’t even said yes.

Grand Maester Pycelle has called a meeting of the Small Council. The honor of your presence is requested. Eddard Stark: Get the girls settled in. I'll be back in time for supper. And, Jory, you go with them. Jory Cassel: Yes, my Lord. King’s Landing Guard: If you'd like to change into something more appropriate… Ned Stark gives the guard a blank stare before taking off his gloves, the guard realizes Ned’s disinterest and the two begin walking to the council chamber. First they walk through the Great Hall, where the throne sits. Jaime Lannister is lingering in front of the throne. Jaime Lannister: Thank the gods you're here, Stark. About time we had some stern northern leadership. Eddard Stark: Glad to see you're protecting the throne. Jaime Lannister: Sturdy old thing. How many kings' asses have polished it, I wonder? What's the line? The King shits and the Hand wipes. Eddard Stark: Very handsome armor. Not a scratch on it. Jaime Lannister: I know. People have been swinging at me for years, but they always seem to miss. Eddard Stark: You've chosen your opponents wisely then. Jaime Lannister: I have a knack for it. It must be strange for you coming into this room. I was standing right here when it happened. He was very brave, your brother. Your father too. They didn't deserve to die like that. Nobody deserves to die like that. Eddard Stark: But you just stood there and watched. Jaime Lannister: 500 men just stood there and watched. All the great knights of the Seven Kingdoms. You think anyone said a word, lifted a finger? No, Lord Stark. 500 men and this room was silent as a crypt. Except for the screams, of course, and the Mad King laughing. And later... When I watched the Mad King die, I remembered him laughing as your father burned... It felt like justice. Eddard Stark: Is that what you tell yourself at night? You're a servant of justice? That you were avenging my father when you shoved your sword in Aerys Targaryen's back? Jaime Lannister: Tell me... If I'd stabbed the Mad King in the belly instead of the back, would you admire me more? Eddard Stark: You served him well, when serving was safe. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Ned enters the small council’s chamber where the others are already awaiting him. Varys: Lord Stark. Eddard Stark: Lord Varys. Varys: I was grievously sorry to hear of your troubles on the Kingsroad. We are all praying for Prince Joffrey's full recovery. Eddard Stark: A shame you didn't say a prayer for the butcher's son. Renly! You're looking well. Renly Baratheon: And you look tired from the road. I told them this meeting could wait another day, but... Petyr Baelish: But we have a Kingdom to look after. I've hoped to meet you for some time, Lord Stark. No doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me. Eddard Stark: She has, Lord Baelish. I understand you knew my brother Brandon as well. Petyr Baelish: All too well. I still carry a token of his esteem from navel to collarbone. Eddard Stark: Perhaps you chose the wrong man to duel with. Petyr Baelish: It wasn't the man that I chose, my Lord. It was Catelyn Tully. A woman worth fighting for, I'm sure you'll agree. Grand Maester Pycelle: I humbly beg your pardon, my Lord Stark. Eddard Stark: Grand Maester. Grand Maester Pycelle: How many years has it been? You were a young man. Eddard Stark: And you served another King. Grand Maester Pycelle: How forgetful of me. This belongs to you, now. Should we begin? Eddard Stark: Without the King? Renly Baratheon: Winter may be coming, but I'm afraid the same cannot be said for my brother. Varys: His Grace has many cares. He entrusts some small matters to us that we might lighten the load. Petyr Baelish: We are the lords of small matters here. Renly Baratheon: My brother instructs us to stage a tournament in honor of Lord Stark's appointment as Hand of the King. Petyr Baelish: Mmm, how much? Eddard Stark: 40,000 gold dragons to the champion, 20,000 to the runner-up, 20,000 to the winning archer. Grand Maester Pycelle: Can the treasury bear such expense? Petyr Baelish: I'll have to borrow it. The Lannisters will accommodate, I expect. We already owe Lord Tywin 3 million gold. What's another 80,000? Eddard Stark: Are you telling me the Crown is three million in debt? Petyr Baelish: I'm telling you the Crown is six million in debt. Eddard Stark: How could you let this happen? Petyr Baelish: The Master of Coin finds the money. The King and the Hand spend it. Eddard Stark: I will not believe Jon Arryn allowed Robert to bankrupt the realm. Grand Maester Pycelle: Lord Arryn gave wise and prudent advice, but I fear His Grace doesn't always listen. Renly Baratheon: ""Counting coppers,"" he calls it. Eddard Stark: I'll speak to him tomorrow. This tournament is an extravagance we cannot afford. Petyr Baelish: As you will. But still, we'd best make our plans. Eddard Stark: There will be no plans until I speak to Robert. Forgive me, my Lords. I had a long ride.

Cersei Baratheon: Please, it's nearly healed. Joffrey Baratheon: It's ugly. Cersei Baratheon: A King should have scars, you fought off a direwolf. You're a warrior like your father. Joffrey Baratheon: I'm not like him. I didn't fight off anything. It bit me and all I did was scream. And the two Stark girls saw it, both of them. Cersei Baratheon: That's not true. You killed the beast. You only spared the girl because of the love your father bears her father. When Aerys Targaryen sat on the Iron Throne, your father was a rebel and a traitor. Someday you'll sit on the throne and the truth will be what you make it. Joffrey Baratheon: Do I have to marry her? Cersei Baratheon: Yes. She's very beautiful and young. If you don't like her, you only need to see her on formal occasions and when the time comes, to make little princes and princesses. And if you'd rather fuck painted whores, you'll fuck painted whores. And if you'd rather lie with noble virgins, so be it. You are my darling boy and the world will be exactly as you want it to be. Do something nice for the Stark girl. Joffrey Baratheon: I don't want to. Cersei Baratheon: No, but you will. The occasional kindness will spare you all sorts of trouble down the road. Joffrey Baratheon: We allow the northerners too much power. They consider themselves our equals. Cersei Baratheon: How would you handle them? Joffrey Baratheon: I'd double their taxes and command them to supply 10,000 men to the royal army. Cersei Baratheon: A royal army? Joffrey Baratheon: Why should every lord command his own men? It's primitive, no better than the hill tribes. We should have a standing army of men loyal to the Crown, trained by experienced soldiers... Instead of a mob of peasants who've never held pikes in their lives. Cersei Baratheon: And if the northerners rebel? Joffrey Baratheon: I'd crush them. Seize Winterfell and install someone loyal to the realm as Warden of the North. Uncle Kevan, maybe. Cersei Baratheon: And these 10,000 northern troops, would they fight for you or their lord? Joffrey Baratheon: For me. I'm their King. Cersei Baratheon: But you've just invaded their homeland, asked them to kill their brothers. Joffrey Baratheon: I'm not asking. Cersei Baratheon: The North cannot be held... not by an outsider. It's too big and too wild. When the winter comes, the Seven gods together couldn't save you and your royal army. A good King knows when to save his strength... And when to destroy his enemies. Joffrey Baratheon: So you agree... The Starks are enemies? Cersei Baratheon: Everyone who isn't us is an enemy. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Arya, Sansa and their Septa are all around a table eating. Arya is stabbing a knife into the table between her fingers. Septa Mordane: Enough of that, young lady. Eat your food. Arya Stark: I'm practicing. Sansa Stark: Practicing for what? Arya Stark: The Prince. Septa Mordane: Arya, stop! Arya Stark: He's a liar and a coward and he killed my friend. Sansa Stark: The Hound killed your friend. Arya Stark: The Hound does whatever the Prince tells him to do. Sansa Stark: You're an idiot. Arya Stark: You're a liar. And if you told the truth, Mycah would be alive. Septa Mordane: Enough! Septa Mordane begins escorting Arya away from the table as Ned walks in. Eddard Stark: What's happening here? Septa Mordane: Arya would rather act like a beast than a lady. Eddard Stark: Go to your room. We'll speak later. That's for you, love… Ned places a wrapped package in front of Sansa on the table. Eddard Stark: The same dollmaker makes all of Princess Myrcella's toys. Don't you like it? Sansa Stark: I haven't played with dolls since I was eight. May I be excused? Septa Mordane: You've barely eaten a thing. Eddard Stark: It's all right. Go on. Sansa gets up from the table, leaving only Ned and Septa Mordane. Eddard Stark: War was easier than daughters. Arya is unsheathing Needle privately in her room as Ned knocks on the door. Arya Stark: Go away! Eddard Stark: Arya, open the door. May I come in? Whose sword is that? Arya Stark: Mine. Eddard Stark: Give it to me. I know this maker's mark. This is Mikken's work. Where did you get this? This is no toy. Little ladies shouldn't play with swords. Arya Stark: I wasn't playing. And I don't want to be a lady. Eddard Stark: Come here. Now what do you want with this? Arya Stark: It's called Needle. Eddard Stark: A blade with a name. And who were you hoping to skewer with Needle? Your sister? Do you know the first thing about sword fighting? Arya Stark: Stick 'em with the pointy end. Eddard Stark:"

433,1,0,JOFFREY,"(Sighs). Take him away. I'll have him killed tomorrow, the fool. The barrel and funnel are removed, and Ser Dontos is released. He pukes out a mixture of blood and wine onto the ground."
434,1,0,SANSA,He is. A fool - you're so clever to see it. He'll make a much better fool than a knight. He doesn't deserve the mercy of a quick death.
435,1,0,JOFFREY,"Did you hear My Lady, Ser Dontos? (Ser Dontos is forced onto his feet). From this day, (Standing up), you'll be my new fool."
436,1,0,DONTOS,"Thank you, Your Grace. (Bows). And you, My Lady, thank you. Ser Dontos is taken away by kingsguard."
437,1,0,TYRION,"Beloved nephew. Tyrion, Bronn, and a number of hill tribesman appear from the right. People murmur and look their way."
438,1,0,TYRION,We looked for you on the battlefield. (Joffrey sits down). You were nowhere to be found. Tyrion begins to pour himself a glass of wine.
439,1,0,JOFFREY,"I've been here, ruling the kingdoms."
440,1,0,TYRION,"What a fine job you've done. (Turns to Myrcella). Look at you. (Kisses her). More beautiful than ever. (Turns to Tommen). And you! You, you're going to be bigger than the Hound, but much better looking. (Tyrion smiles. He and Myrcella laugh). This one doesn't like me. Tyrion gestures towards the Hound. Bronn looks over at the Hound and smiles wryly."
441,1,0,BRONN,Can't imagine why.
442,1,0,JOFFREY,We heard you were dead.
443,1,0,MYRCELLA,I'm glad you're not dead. Tyrion takes a sip of his wine.
444,1,0,TYRION,"Me, too, dear. Death is so boring, especially now with so much excitement in the world. (Looks at Sansa). My Lady, I'm sorry for your loss. Tyrion bows to Sansa. Joffrey looks over at her, and back to Tyrion."
445,1,0,JOFFREY,Her loss? Her father was a confessed traitor!
446,1,0,TYRION,But still her father. Surely having so recently lost your own beloved father you can sympathize.
447,1,0,SANSA,"My father was a traitor. My mother and brother are traitors, too. I am loyal to my beloved Joffrey."
448,1,0,TYRION,Of course you are. Tyrion smirks sympathetically. Sansa looks away.
449,1,0,TYRION,"Well, (Gulps down his wine), enjoy your name day, Your Grace. Wish I could stay and celebrate, but there is work to be done. Tyrion begins walking away from the tent."
450,1,0,JOFFREY,What work? (Bronn and the tribesmen follow Tyrion. Joffrey stands up). Why are you here? INT. SMALL COUNCIL MEETING CHAMBER The council members sit at a table. A man walks to the table with a covered bird cage.
451,1,0,PYCELLE,"The raven arrived from the Citadel this morning, Your Grace. The conclave has met, (The man sets the cage down and removes the cover), considered reports from Maesters all over the Seven Kingdoms, and declared this great summer done, at last. The longest summer in living memory."
452,1,0,VARYS,"The peasants say, a long summer means an even longer winter."
453,1,0,PYCELLE,A common superstition.
454,1,0,BAELISH,"We have enough wheat for a five-year winter. If it lasts any longer, (Shrugs indifferently), we'll have fewer peasants."
455,1,0,JANOS,"The city's drowning in refugees, Your Grace, fleeing the war. We have nowhere to house them, and with winter coming, it'll only get worse. Cersei gestures to a servant. The servant comes to take the raven off of the table."
456,1,0,CERSEI,"You command the City Watch, do you not, Lord Slynt?"
457,1,0,JANOS,"I do, Your Grace."
458,1,0,CERSEI,And are you not a Lord at my command?
459,1,0,JANOS,"I owe my title and lands to your generosity, Your Grace."
460,1,0,CERSEI,"Then do your job. Shut the gates to the peasants. They belong in the field, not our capital."
461,1,0,JANOS,"Yes, Your Grace. Tyrion begins whistling from a distance. Everyone at the table turns to watch him approach."
462,1,0,TYRION,"Don't get up. More ravishing than ever, big sister. (Kisses Cersei on the cheek). War agrees with you. Forgive the interruption, carry on."
463,1,0,CERSEI,What are you doing here?
464,1,0,TYRION,"(Sits down) It's been a remarkable journey. I, (grabs a glass), pissed off the edge of the Wall, I slept in a sky cell. (Pours himself wine). I fought with the hill tribes. So many adventures, so much to be thankful for. Tyrion begins drinking his wine."
465,1,0,CERSEI,What are you doing here? This is the small council.
466,1,0,TYRION,"Yes., well, I, do believe the Hand of the King is welcome at all small council meetings."
467,1,0,CERSEI,Our father is Hand of the King.
468,1,0,TYRION,"Yes, but in his absence… Tyrion pulls out a letter. He hands it to Varys, who opens it, and begins reading it."
469,1,0,VARYS,Your father has named Lord Tyrion to serve as Hand in his stead while he fights -
470,1,0,CERSEI,Out! All of you out. (The small council members all get up and leave until it is only Cersei and Tyrion. Cersei stands up and approaches Tyrion). I would like to know how you tricked father into this.
471,1,0,TYRION,"If I were capable of tricking father, I'd be emperor of the world by now. You brought this on yourself. (Cersei sits down)."
472,1,0,CERSEI,I've done nothing.
473,1,0,TYRION,Quite right. You did nothing when your son called for Ned Stark's head. Now the entire North has risen up against us.
474,1,0,CERSEI,I tried to stop it.
475,1,0,TYRION,Did you? You failed. That bit of theater will haunt our family for a generation.
476,1,0,CERSEI,Robb Stark is a child.
477,1,0,TYRION,Who's won every battle he's fought. Do you understand we're losing the war?
478,1,0,CERSEI,What do you know about warfare?
479,1,0,TYRION,Nothing. But I know people. And I know that our enemies hate each other almost as much as they hate us. There is a long pause. Cersei looks over at Tyrion.
480,1,0,CERSEI,Joffrey is King.
481,1,0,TYRION,Joffrey is King.
482,1,0,CERSEI,You are here to advise him.
483,1,0,TYRION,"I'm only here to advise him. And if the King listens to what I say, the King might just get his Uncle Jaime back."
484,1,0,CERSEI,How?
485,1,0,TYRION,You love your children. It's your one redeeming quality. That and your cheekbones. The Starks love their children as well. And we have two of them.
486,1,0,CERSEI,One.
487,1,0,TYRION,One?
488,1,0,CERSEI,"Arya, little animal, she disappeared."
489,1,0,TYRION,"Disappeared? What, in a puff of smoke? We had three Starks to trade. You chopped one's head off and let another escape. Father will be furious. It must be odd for you to be the disappointing child. Tyrion smirks, and takes a sip of his wine. Cersei looks away."
490,1,0,TO,"WINTERFELL EXT. OUTSIDE WINTERFELL A knight sits on a horse alone, holding a banner. Winterfell is seen in the background."
491,1,0,LORD,"My Lord, may the Old Gods watch over your brother and all our northern sons. INT. INSIDE WINTERFELL’S KEEP A long queue of people are waiting to speak with Bran. The man speaking is addressing Bran and Maester Luwin, who are both sitting at a large table."
492,1,0,LORD,"The walls of my Holdfast will not stand the winter. The stones were last mortared in the time of King Aerys, and I'm afraid the masons today are not fit to carry their fathers' hammers. When I was a boy, I remember seeing them put up a new tower at Torrhen's Square in a summer. Men worked back then. Today, my Holdfast looks like it was built by drunk children. At night you can hear the wind howling through the gaps. And the Gods forbid it rains. Why, I might as well sleep beneath a waterfall."
493,1,0,LUWIN,Maintenance of a Holdfast generally falls to the lord of that Holdfast.
494,1,0,LORD,"Generally, yes, but I've sent all the young men off to fight Robb Stark's war."
495,1,0,BRAN,King Robb. And it's not his war. He didn't choose it.
496,1,0,LORD,"Maybe not, My Lord, but he called in his Banners, and took the men."
497,1,0,BRAN,"Joffrey killed my father, your liege lord. Do you remember your vows, Ser?"
498,1,0,LORD,Of course I remember!
499,1,0,LUWIN,"We can spare four masons for a week, My Lord. Will that be sufficient to repair your walls?"
500,1,0,LORD,"I - I believe it will. The man walks away. After a moment, Luwin turns to Bran."
501,1,0,LUWIN,"We didn't want him here all day, did we?"
502,1,0,BRAN,I didn't like the way he was talking about Robb.
503,1,0,LUWIN,Nor did I. But listening to people you'd rather not listen to is one of your responsibilities as Lord of Winterfell. (Bran sighs). Lord Portan.
504,1,0,PORTAN,"(Walks forward). My Lord, may the Old Gods watch over your brother and all our northern sons. EXT. WOODS The camera changes to first-person. A character is running through the woods, panting.  The character looks up to the red comet above the trees, and then back down to the pool in the godswood. The character approaches the pool and looks down at their reflection, revealing themselves to be Summer, Bran’s direwolf. INT. BRAN’S BEDROOM Bran lays in his bed, asleep. His eyes suddenly open. EXT. WOODS - LATER THAT DAY Hodor walks with Bran on his back, closely following Osha. Osha squats next to some plants. Hodor continues walking."
505,1,0,OSHA,Boil this for an hour and drink the tea. Makes all your pain go away. Osha pockets some of the plant.
506,1,0,BRAN,Don't have any pain.
507,1,0,OSHA,Lucky for you.
508,1,0,BRAN,"That way. Bran points, and Hodor changes direction, heading for the godswood. Osha turns and begins following them."
509,1,0,OSHA,You've been having those dreams again.
510,1,0,BRAN,I don't dream.
511,1,0,OSHA,Everyone dreams.
512,1,0,BRAN,I don't. Heard some of the men talking about the comet. (Bran looks up at the comet). They say it's an omen. They say it means Robb will win a great victory in the South.
513,1,0,OSHA,"Did they? (Hodor is kneeling next to the pool in the godswood. Osha begins unstrapping Bran from Hodor’s back). I heard some other fools say it's Lannister Red. Means the Lannisters will rule all Seven Kingdoms before long. I heard a stable boy say it's the color of blood, to mark the death of your father. Osha places Bran on the ground. He begins crawling towards the edge of the pool."
514,1,0,OSHA,"The stars don't fall for men. The red comet means one thing, boy. Dragons. Bran looks at his reflection in the pool."
515,1,0,BRAN,The dragons are all dead. They've been dead for centuries.
516,1,0,TO,"ESSOS EXT. DESERT Some people walk through the desert. The camera pans up to reveal Daenerys, with Drogon on her shoulder, and her Khalasar. Daenerys attempts to feed Drogon some meat, but he refuses."
517,1,0,DOREAH,"What did your brother say about them, Khaleesi?"
518,1,0,DAENERYS,He said they ate meat.
519,1,0,DOREAH,He didn't tell you what kind of meat?
520,1,0,DAENERYS,"My brother didn't know anything about dragons. He didn't know anything about anything. Doreah looks down dejectedly . Daenerys gets Drogon off of her shoulder and into his cage. At the front of the group, a horse suddenly collapses. Jorah jogs forward to investigate. Daenerys follows after him. Daenerys kneels down to look at the horse. She looks up at Jorah, who shakes his head. Daenerys looks down sadly."
521,1,0,DAENERYS,She was Drogo's first gift to me.
522,1,0,JORAH,I remember.
523,1,0,DAENERYS,I promised to protect them. Promised them their enemies would die screaming. How do I make starvation scream?
524,1,0,JORAH,"A trick I never learned, I'm afraid."
525,1,0,DAENERYS,Does it ever end?
526,1,0,JORAH,"This is further east than I've ever been. But, yes, Khaleesi, everything ends, even the red waste."
527,1,0,DAENERYS,And you're sure there's no other way?
528,1,0,JORAH,"If we go south to the land of the Lazarheen, the Lamb Men will kill us and take your dragons. If we go west to the Dothraki Sea, the first Khalasar we meet will kill us and take your dragons."
529,1,0,DAENERYS,No one will take my dragons.
530,1,0,JORAH,"They are too weak to fight, as are your people. You must be their strength."
531,1,0,DAENERYS,"(Turns to Jorah) As you are mine. Daenerys says something in Dothraki, calling Rakharo and some others over. She then stands up, and addresses Rakharo and two others."
532,1,0,DAENERYS,"(Speaking Dothraki) Rakharo, Aggo, Kovarro. Take our remaining horses. You will ride east, you southeast, and you northeast."
533,1,0,RAKHARO,"(Speaking Dothraki) What do we seek, Khaleesi?"
534,1,0,DAENERYS,"(Speaking Dothraki) Cities, living or dead. Caravans and people. Rivers or lakes or the great salt sea. Find how far the Red Waste extends before us, and what lies on the other side. Rakharo and the other two riders walk away. Later, as Rakharo is almost ready to leave, Daenerys approaches him."
535,1,0,DAENERYS,"(Speaking Dothraki) Rokharo, you are my last hope, blood of my blood."
536,1,0,RAKHARO,"(Speaking Dothraki) I will not fail you, blood of my blood."
537,1,0,DAENERYS,You never have.
538,1,0,RAKHARO,"This is… bad time to start. Rakharo and the other two riders take off. Daenerys stares at the red comet, looking troubled."
539,1,0,TO,"BEYOND THE WALL EXT. WOODS The large party of Night’s Watchmen continue through the woods on horseback. Sam, Grenn, and Edd surround a sledge trapped in the snow on the side of the road."
540,1,0,JON,Having a rough time of it?
541,1,0,SAM,Nothing's killed me yet.
542,1,0,GRENN,Your ass killed the sledge.
543,1,0,SAM,You offered me a ride!
544,1,0,GRENN,I just wanted you to shut up about your damn blisters. The party reaches a large camp. Some of them dismount. The camera pans up to view a large wooden house in the center.
545,1,0,EDD,"I was born in a place like this. Later, I fell on hard times. The camera moves through the camp, to show some of the women working."
546,1,0,SAM,Are those girls?
547,1,0,EDD,Craster's daughters.
548,1,0,SAM,I haven't seen a girl in six months.
549,1,0,EDD,I'd keep on not seeing them if I were you.
550,1,0,GRENN,"What, he don't like people messing with his daughters?"
551,1,0,EDD,"(Smirking) He don't like people messing with his wives. Jon, Sam, and Grenn all look at Edd, surprised."
552,1,0,EDD,"He marries his daughters, and they give him more daughters, and on, and on it goes."
553,1,0,SAM,That's foul.
554,1,0,GRENN,It's beyond foul.
555,1,0,EDD,All the other wildlings for a hundred leagues have disappeared. Craster's still here. He must be doing something right.
556,1,0,JON,What happens to the boys?
557,1,0,SAM,Hmm?
558,1,0,JON,"He marries his daughters. What does he do with his sons? INT. CRASTER’S LODGE Craster, Mormont, and a number of watchmen sit around a fire."
559,1,0,MORMONT,He said he planned to stop here on his way to the Frostfangs.
560,1,0,CRASTER,"People make all sorts of plans. I haven't seen Benjen Stark in three years. Haven't missed him. Always treated me like scum. (Sips his wine). Haven't had any good wine for a long time. You Southerners make good wine, I'll give you that."
561,1,0,JON,(Standing off to the side of the room) We're not Southerners.
562,1,0,CRASTER,Who's this little girl? You're prettier than half my daughters. You got a nice wet twat between your legs? What's your name?
563,1,0,JON,Jon Snow.
564,1,0,CRASTER,"Snow, eh? Listen to me, bastard. All you lot from south of the Wall, you're Southerners. But now you're in the North, the real North."
565,1,0,MORMONT,The lad meant no harm.
566,1,0,CRASTER,I catch that pretty little bastard talking to my daughters -
567,1,0,MORMONT,"No one will talk to your daughters, you have my word. (Turns to Jon) Now, sit down and shut your mouth. Jon takes a seat at the fire."
568,1,0,CRASTER,You bring any of that good wine with you?
569,1,0,MORMONT,"We did. We passed through six villages on the way here. All six were abandoned. Where have all the wildlings gone? As the conversation continues, Jon looks around at some of Craster’s daughters in the rafters."
570,1,0,CRASTER,"I could tell you, but I'm thirsty."
571,1,0,MORMONT,There's a barrel of Dornish wine on the sledge. Bring it in here.
572,1,0,WATCHMAN,"Yes, commander."
573,1,0,CRASTER,You want to know where they've all gone? North! To join up with Mance Rayder Your old friend.
574,1,0,MORMONT,"He's no friend of mine. He broke his vows, betrayed his brothers!"
575,1,0,CRASTER,"Oh, aye. But once he was just a poor black crow. And now he's King-Beyond-the-Wall."
576,1,0,MORMONT,He's been calling himself that for years. What’s he king of? A frozen lake somewhere? Craster looks at the watchman sitting next to Mormont and points.
577,1,0,CRASTER,That's a good-looking axe. Fresh forged?
578,1,0,MORMONT,"Give it here. Mormont beckons to the watchman, who begrudgingly hands Mormont the axe."
579,1,0,MORMONT,You'll have another one made at Castle Black. (Hands the axe to Craster). Here.
580,1,0,CRASTER,"(Inspecting the axe). Oh, that's some lovely steel. (Loudly brings the axe down). You want to know what Mance Rayder is doing? Gathering an army. What I hear, he's already got more men than any of your southern kings."
581,1,0,MORMONT,And where does he plan marching this army?
582,1,0,CRASTER,"When you're all the way north, there's only one direction to go."
583,1,0,MORMONT,These are bad times to be living alone in the wild. The cold winds are rising.
584,1,0,CRASTER,"Let them come. My roots are sunk deep. (Grabs Gilly) Wife, tell the Lord Crow how content we are."
585,1,0,GILLY,This is our place. Our husband keeps us safe. Better to live free than die a slave.
586,1,0,CRASTER,"Don't it make you jealous, old man, to see me with all these young wives and you with no one to warm your bed?"
587,1,0,MORMONT,We chose different paths.
588,1,0,CRASTER,"Oh, aye, and you chose the path with no one but boys on it. (Stands up).  You'll be wanting to sleep beneath my roof, I suppose, and eat me out of pigs."
589,1,0,MORMONT,(Stands up) A roof would be welcome. It's been hard riding. We've brought our own food and good steel for you.
590,1,0,CRASTER,"(Addressing the group). Any man lays a hand on one of my wives, he loses the hand. And I see this one, (Gestures towards Jon),  staring too long, I might just gouge his eyes out."
591,1,0,MORMONT,"Your roof, your rules. The crows all leave the lodge. EXT. IN THE CAMP Mormont roughly grabs Jon and pins him against a wooden post."
592,1,0,MORMONT,(Angrily) Who am I? (Jon looks confused) Who am I?
593,1,0,JON,Lord commander.
594,1,0,MORMONT,And who are you?
595,1,0,JON,Jon Snow.
596,1,0,MORMONT,Who are you?
597,1,0,JON,Your steward.
598,1,0,MORMONT,You want to lead one day? (Jon nods). Then learn how to follow.
599,1,0,TO,"DRAGONSTONE EXT. BEACH The camera pans down from the red comet to Maester Cressen, holding a torch and running. Melisandre can be heard speaking in the distance."
600,1,0,MELISANDRE,"Lord of Light, come to us in our darkness. We offer you these false Gods. Cressen approaches a group gathered on the beach, burning some effigies. Melisandre is speaking to them."
601,1,0,MELISANDRE,Take them and cast your light upon us. For the night is dark and full of terrors.
602,1,0,GROUP,(In unison) For the night is dark and full of terrors. Cressen reaches the group and hands his torch to another man.
603,1,0,MELISANDRE,"After the long summer, darkness will fall heavy on the world. Stars will bleed."
604,1,0,CRESSEN,(To Davos) We need to stop her!
605,1,0,MELISANDRE,The cold breath of winter will freeze the seas.
606,1,0,DAVOS,(Looks to Stannis) Not now.
607,1,0,MELISANDRE,And the dead shall rise in the North.
608,1,0,CRESSEN,"(Walks forward, interrupting Melisandre). All you men were named in the Light of the Seven! Is this how you treat the Gods of your fathers? Are you so eager to spit on your ancestors? After a long silence, Melisandre approaches Cressen and caresses his face."
609,1,0,MELISANDRE,"You smell of fear, fear and piss and old bones. Do you want to stop me? Stop me. After a moment, Cressen begrudgingly stands aside."
610,1,0,MELISANDRE,"In the ancient books, it's written that a warrior will draw a burning sword from the fire. And that sword shall be Lightbringer. Stannis Baratheon, warrior of light, your sword awaits you. Stannis approaches one of the burning effigies as everyone else looks on. He pulls a sword out from the base and carries it high, to applause. When he sticks it in the sand, the crowd kneels."
611,1,0,CROWD,"Lord, cast your light upon us!"
612,1,0,MELISANDRE,For the night is dark and full of terrors.
613,1,0,STANNIS,"For the night is dark and full of terror. Stannis then walks away, almost forgetting to bring his wife with him. The rest of the crowd gets up to leave moments later. Davos and Cressen stay behind a moment to talk."
614,1,0,CRESSEN,This woman will lead him into a war he cannot win.
615,1,0,DAVOS,"Stannis is our king. We follow where he leads, even if we don't like the path."
616,1,0,CRESSEN,"(Scoffs) King. Since that boar killed his brother, every lord wants a coronation."
617,1,0,DAVOS,I don't serve the others. I serve Stannis.
618,1,0,CRESSEN,"As do I, but loyal service means telling hard truths. He's surrounded by fools and fanatics, but he trusts you, Davos. (Davos picks up the sword and inspects it).  If you tell him the truth…"
619,1,0,DAVOS,"What's the truth? Cressen looks crestfallen. Davos walks away with the sword. Cressen looks up at the burning effigies. INT. DRAGONSTONE - LATER THAT DAY Matthos reads out a letter for Stannis to proofread, as they and some other characters sit around a table."
620,1,0,MATTHOS,“And I declare upon the honor of my house that my beloved brother Robert le-”
621,1,0,STANNIS,"He wasn't my beloved brother. (Matthos looks up). I didn't love him, he didn't love me."
622,1,0,DAVOS,"A harmless courtesy, Your Grace."
623,1,0,STANNIS,"A lie. Take it out. Matthos scratches ‘beloved’ off of the letter, and then continues."
624,1,0,MATTHOS,"“That my brother Robert left no trueborn heirs; the boy Joffrey, the boy Tommen, and the girl Myrcella, being born of incest between Cersei Lannister and her brother Jaime Lannister. By right of birth -"""
625,1,0,STANNIS,"Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer. Call him what he is. Matthos adds in ‘the Kingslayer,’ and continues. Davos notices Cressen slip something into his own glass of wine."
626,1,0,MATTHOS,"""And her brother Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer. By right of birth and blood, I do this day lay claim -"""
627,1,0,STANNIS,"Make it Ser Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer. Whatever else he is, the man's still a knight."
628,1,0,MATTHOS,"(Adding Ser) ""Ser Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer. By right of birth and blood, I do this day lay claim to the Iron Throne of Westeros. (Stannis nods). Let all true men declare their loyalty.”"
629,1,0,STANNIS,"When Eddard Stark learned the truth, he told only me. I'll not make the same mistake. Send copies of that letter to every corner of the Realm, from the Arbor to the Wall. The time has come to choose. Let no man claim ignorance as an excuse."
630,1,0,DAVOS,"Your Grace, the Lannisters are the true enemy. If, for the time being, you could make peace with your brother -"
631,1,0,STANNIS,I'll not make peace with Renly while he calls himself King.
632,1,0,DAVOS,"Well, many have already declared for him; Mace Tyrell, Randyll Tarly."
633,1,0,MELISANDRE,Stannis does not need to beg this lord or that lord for support. The Lord of Light stands behind him.
634,1,0,DAVOS,And how many ships has the Lord of Light got in his fleet?
635,1,0,MELISANDRE,He has no need for ships.
636,1,0,DAVOS,"I'm sure he doesn't, but we do if we're going to war. If not Renly, Your Grace, join forces with Robb Stark."
637,1,0,STANNIS,"Who would steal the northern half of my kingdom. I've always served thieves according to their desserts, as you well know, Ser Davos. Joffrey, Renly, Robb Stark, they're all thieves. They'll bend the knee or I'll destroy them."
638,1,0,CRESSEN,"(Stands up). I owe you an apology, my King. My duty is to serve. You have chosen the new God over the Old Gods. May the Lord of Light watch over us all. Shall we drink together?"
639,1,0,DAVOS,"(Whispers to Cressen) Don't. Cressen stands up with the drugged glass of wine, and walks over to where Melisandre is sitting."
640,1,0,CRESSEN,"A cup of wine to honor the one true God. Melisandre stands up. Everyone at the table reaches for their own wine glasses. Cressen takes a sip of the drugged wine and offers it to Melisandre. Davos nervously watches her take the glass. Cressen begins to stumble and bleed from his nose. Melisandre drink a large portion of the wine. As he falls to the floor dead, Davos and many others stand up. Melisandre appears unphased by the poison."
641,1,0,MELISANDRE,"The night is dark and full of terrors, old man, but the fire burns them all away. Your Grace."
642,1,0,TO,"NORTH EXT. STARK CAMP The camera pans over a watchtower to a wide shot of the camp. In the camp, Robb stark is led by a man with a torch to where Jaime is being held. Robb enters Jaime’s cage, where he is tied to a wooden pole, a good distance from the walls of the cage."
643,1,0,JAIME,"King in the North. I keep expecting you to leave me in one castle or another for safekeeping, but you drag me along from camp to camp. Have you grown fond of me, Stark? Is that it? I've never seen you with a girl."
644,1,0,ROBB,"If I left you with one of my bannermen, your father would know within a fortnight, and my bannerman would receive a raven with a message, ""Release my son and you'll be rich beyond your dreams. Refuse and your house will be destroyed, root and stem.”"
645,1,0,JAIME,You don't trust the loyalty of the men following you into battle?
646,1,0,ROBB,"Oh, I trust them with my life. Just not with yours."
647,1,0,JAIME,"Smart boy. What's wrong? Don't like being called ‘boy’? Insulted? Robb looks behind Jaime’s cage. As Jaime nervously strains to look behind him, Grey Wind can be heard heavily walking to the front of the cage."
648,1,0,ROBB,"You insult yourself, Kingslayer. You've been defeated by a boy. With Grey Wind now fully in view, Jaime loses his brave facade."
649,1,0,ROBB,You're held captive by a boy. Perhaps you'll be killed by a boy. (Grey Wind enters the cage. Jaime looks very nervous). Stannis Baratheon sent ravens to all the high lords of Westeros. King Joffrey Baratheon is neither a true king nor a true Baratheon. (Jaime focuses back on Robb). He's your bastard son.
650,1,0,JAIME,"If that's true, Stannis is the rightful king. How convenient for him."
651,1,0,ROBB,My father learned the truth. That's why you had him executed.
652,1,0,JAIME,I was your prisoner when Ned Stark lost his head.
653,1,0,ROBB,Your son killed him so the world wouldn't learn who fathered him. And you... you pushed my brother from a window because he saw you with the queen.
654,1,0,JAIME,You have proof? Or do you want to trade gossip like a couple of fishwives?
655,1,0,ROBB,I'm sending one of your cousins down to King's Landing with my peace terms.
656,1,0,JAIME,You think my father's going to negotiate with you? You don't know him very well.
657,1,0,ROBB,"No, but he's starting to know me."
658,1,0,JAIME,Three victories don't make you a conqueror.
659,1,0,ROBB,"It's better than three defeats. Robb nudges Grey Wind towards Jaime and leaves the cage. Grey Wind growls in Jaime’s face and comes close to biting him. Jaime closes his eyes in preparation, but when he opens them back up, Grey Wind is gone."
660,1,0,TO,KING’S LANDING INT. TYRION’S ROOM Shae looks out from the balcony in Tyrion’s room.
661,1,0,SHAE,This city stinks Like dead bodies.
662,1,0,TYRION,"A bit corpsey, yes."
663,1,0,SHAE,"And shit. Shae hops down from the balcony, and walks back into the room."
664,1,0,TYRION,I thought you wanted to come here.
665,1,0,SHAE,I love it.
666,1,0,TYRION,You love the smell of dead bodies and shit?
667,1,0,SHAE,And cum and garlic and rum.
668,1,0,TYRION,You can smell cum from the balcony?
669,1,0,SHAE,I love the stink. I love the noise. Cities make me want to fuck.
670,1,0,TYRION,And so did the country. Shae lays back on Tyrion’s bed.
671,1,0,SHAE,This is where I belong.
672,1,0,TYRION,"Yes, well, you need to be careful. No one can know you're here."
673,1,0,SHAE,No one will know.
674,1,0,TYRION,"You can't trust anyone in King's Landing. They're all liars; good liars, bad liars, one or two great liars."
675,1,0,SHAE,What about you?
676,1,0,TYRION,Me? I'm not from here. I'm a slave to the truth.
677,1,0,SHAE,Truth? (Laughs) You are the biggest little liar I have ever met.
678,1,0,TYRION,"Why do you think I am so little? I'm being, (Lays down on the bed with Shae), crushed beneath the weight of all that truth."
679,1,0,TYRION,"Ned Stark actually slept on this, as if the poor man didn't suffer enough. One of the many changes we'll have to make around here. Tyrion and Shae kiss as a bell rings in the distance. INT. HALLWAY A servant boy can be seen scrubbing something on the floor, as Baelish walks down a hallway next to a courtyard. Cersei and some kingsguard approach from behind."
680,1,0,CERSEI,Lord Baelish.
681,1,0,BAELISH,Your Grace.
682,1,0,CERSEI,I wonder if I might ask you for a favor.
683,1,0,BAELISH,"Of course, Your Grace."
684,1,0,CERSEI,Ned Stark's youngest daughter Arya... we can't seem to locate her. Baelish begins walking with Cersei and her guards.
685,1,0,BAELISH,"If she's escaped the capital, Winterfell seems the logical destination."
686,1,0,CERSEI,And yet my friends in the North report no sign of her.
687,1,0,BAELISH,Curious.
688,1,0,CERSEI,"If we choose to negotiate with the Starks, the girl has some value. Whoever finds her, well, you know what they say about Lannisters and debts."
689,1,0,BAELISH,"Well, you could ask Varys where she is. He'll have an answer for you. Whether you believe it,,, Myself, I have always had a hard time trusting eunuchs. (Smiles) Who knows what they want?"
690,1,0,CERSEI,"A mockingbird. (Points to a pin on Baelish’s shirt). You created your own Sigil, didn't you?"
691,1,0,BAELISH,Yes.
692,1,0,CERSEI,Appropriate for a self-made man with so many songs to sing.
693,1,0,BAELISH,I'm glad you like it. Some people are fortunate enough to be born into the right family. Others have to find their own way.
694,1,0,CERSEI,"I heard a song once about a boy of modest means who found his way into the home of a very prominent family. He loved the eldest daughter. Sadly, she had eyes for another."
695,1,0,BAELISH,"When boys and girls live in the same home, awkward situations can arise. Sometimes, I've heard, even brothers and sisters develop certain affections. And when these affections become common knowledge, well, that is an awkward situation, indeed. Especially in a prominent family. But prominent families often forget a simple truth, I've found."
696,1,0,CERSEI,And which truth is that?
697,1,0,BAELISH,Knowledge is power.
698,1,0,CERSEI,"Seize him. (Cersei’s guards seize Baelish). Cut his throat. (A guard holds a knife to Baelish’s neck). Stop. Wait. I've changed my mind. Let him go. (The guards let Baelish go). Step back three paces. Turn around. Close your eyes. (The guards do as Cersei says). (To Baelish) Power is power. Do see if you can take some time away from your coins and your whores to locate the Stark girl for me. I would very much appreciate it. Cersei walks away from Baelish, her guards following close behind. The servant boy scrubbing the floor looks up at Baelish."
699,1,0,TO,NORTH INT. ROBB’S TENT
700,1,0,ROBB,You're Ser Alton Lannister?
701,1,0,ALTON,"I am, Your Grace."
702,1,0,ROBB,"I offer your cousins peace if they meet my terms. First, your family must release my sisters. Second, my father's bones must be returned to us so he may rest beside his brother and sister in the crypts beneath Winterfell. And the remains of all those who died in his service must also be returned. Their families can honor them with proper funerals."
703,1,0,ALTON,"An honorable request, Your Grace."
704,1,0,ROBB,"Third... Joffrey and the Queen Regent must renounce all claim to dominion of the North. From this time, till the end of time, we are a free and independent kingdom. Alton looks at him wide-eyed."
705,1,0,RODRIK,The King in the North.
706,1,0,TABLE,King in the North.
707,1,0,ROBB,"Neither Joffrey nor any of his men shall set foot in our lands again. If he disregards this command, he shall suffer the same fate as my father, only I don't need a servant to do my beheading for me."
708,1,0,ALTON,"These are... Your Grace, these are..."
709,1,0,ROBB,"These are my terms. If the Queen Regent and her son meet them, I'll give them peace. If not, I will litter the south with Lannister dead."
710,1,0,ALTON,"King Joffrey is a Baratheon, Your Grace."
711,1,0,ROBB,"Oh, is he? You'll ride at daybreak, Ser Alton. That will be all for tonight. After everyone else leaves the tent, Theon approaches Robb."
712,1,0,THEON,"A word, Your Grace?"
713,1,0,ROBB,You don't have to call me ‘Your Grace’ when no one's around.
714,1,0,THEON,It's not so bad once you get used to it.
715,1,0,ROBB,I'm glad someone's gotten used to it.
716,1,0,THEON,"The Lannisters are going to reject your terms, you know?"
717,1,0,ROBB,Of course they are.
718,1,0,THEON,"We can fight them in the fields as long as you like, but we won't beat them until you take King's Landing. And we can't take King's Landing without ships. My father has ships and men who know how to sail them."
719,1,0,ROBB,Men who fought my father.
720,1,0,THEON,"Men who fought King Robert to free themselves from the yoke of the South, just like you're doing now. I'm his only living son. He'll listen to me. I know he will. I'm not a Stark. I know that. But your father raised me to be an honorable man. We can avenge him together. INT. A DIFFERENT TENT - LATER"
721,1,0,CATELYN,You don't want Balon Greyjoy for an ally.
722,1,0,ROBB,I need his ships. They say he has 200.
723,1,0,CATELYN,"They say a million rats live in the sewers of King's Landing. Shall we rally them to fight for us? Catelyn is preparing to go somewhere, gathering up various items."
724,1,0,ROBB,I understand you don't trust Lord Greyjoy.
725,1,0,CATELYN,I don't trust Lord Greyjoy because he is not trustworthy. Your father had to go to war to end his rebellion.
726,1,0,ROBB,"Yes. And now I'm the one rebelling against the throne. Before me, it was father. You married one rebel and mothered another."
727,1,0,CATELYN,"I mothered more than just rebels, a fact you seem to have forgotten."
728,1,0,ROBB,"If I trade the Kingslayer for two girls, my bannermen will string me up by my feet."
729,1,0,CATELYN,"You want to leave Sansa in the Queen's hands? And Arya, I haven't heard a word about Arya. What are we fighting for if not for them?"
730,1,0,ROBB,It's more complicated than that! You know it is. A long pause follows. Catelyn sits down.
731,1,0,CATELYN,It's time for me to go home. I haven't seen Bran or Rickon in months.
732,1,0,ROBB,You can't go to Winterfell.
733,1,0,CATELYN,I beg your pardon?
734,1,0,ROBB,"I'll send Rodrik to watch over the boys, ‘cause tomorrow, you'll ride south to the Stormlands."
735,1,0,CATELYN,Why in the name of all the Gods -
736,1,0,ROBB,"Because I need you to negotiate with Renly Baratheon. He's rallied an army of 100,000. You know him. You know his family."
737,1,0,CATELYN,I haven't seen Renly Baratheon since he was a boy. You have a hundred other lords -
738,1,0,ROBB,"Which of these lords do I trust more than you? If Renly sides with us, we'll outnumber them two to one. When they feel the jaws beginning to shut, they'll sue for peace. We'll get the girls back. Then we'll all go home for good."
739,1,0,CATELYN,"I will ride at first light. Robb kisses Catelyn’s forehead, and they embrace."
740,1,0,ROBB,"We will all be together again soon, I promise."
741,1,0,CATELYN,You've done so well. Your father would be proud.
742,1,0,ROBB,(Pauses) Give Lord Renly my regards.
743,1,0,CATELYN,King Renly. There's a king in every corner now.
744,1,0,TO,"KING’S LANDING INT. THRONE ROOM Cersei and her guards enter the throne room. Extensive work is being done, overseen by Joffrey."
745,1,0,CERSEI,What is all this?
746,1,0,JOFFREY,"Returning this room to its proper appearance. Say what you will about the Targaryens, they were conquerors. That is a seat for a conqueror. It needs a room to match it, not vines and flowers."
747,1,0,CERSEI,We can't find Arya Stark.
748,1,0,JOFFREY,"With luck, she's dead in a ditch somewhere."
749,1,0,CERSEI,"Perhaps. But if not, we need her. They'll never give Jaime back to us for Sansa alone."
750,1,0,JOFFREY,I think they might. They're weak. They put too much value on their women. (Walks towards the throne).
751,1,0,CERSEI,We need to set our armies to the task of finding her. Send out as many men as we can. I'm sure if you asked grandfather -
752,1,0,JOFFREY,The King does not ask; He commands. And my grandfather's stupidity in the field of battle is the reason Robb Stark has Uncle Jaime in the first place.
753,1,0,CERSEI,His life is in danger.
754,1,0,JOFFREY,We're at war. All our lives are in danger. I heard a disgusting lie about Uncle Jaime. And you.
755,1,0,CERSEI,Our enemies will say anything to weaken your claim to the throne.
756,1,0,JOFFREY,It's not a claim. The throne is mine.
757,1,0,CERSEI,Of course it is. No one believes this foul gossip -
758,1,0,JOFFREY,Someone believes it. Father had other children? Besides me and Tommen and Myrcella?
759,1,0,CERSEI,What are you asking?
760,1,0,JOFFREY,"I'm asking if he fucked other women when he grew tired of you. How many bastards does he have running - Cersei instinctively slaps Joffrey. It grows quiet as many workers look over at Joffrey and Cersei. Joffre looks up shocked, and then around to the workers in the room. Cersei appears nervous."
761,1,0,JOFFREY,"What you just did is punishable by death. You will never do it again. Never. (Joffrey begins to walk away). That will be all, Mother. INT. BROTHEL A man and a woman are having sex. The woman is shrieking loudly."
762,1,0,ROZ,"No, no, no, no. Do you have any idea how ridiculous you sound? Ease into it. Slowly, with passion. The man and woman go back to having sex, this time with the woman slowly moaning."
763,1,0,ROZ,Go wash yourselves. Put some clothes on. Both of you are working tonight. Roz walks Daisy through the brothel.
764,1,0,ROZ,"We do things differently here, Daisy. This isn't some five-copper bawdy house in Hayseed Hall."
765,1,0,DAISY,Haystack Hall.
766,1,0,ROZ,Wherever you're from. Our establishment doesn't cater to ploughmen and goat herders. (Nods to a man walking past). Lord Olsen. Taste is everything here.
767,1,0,DAISY,Littlefinger's a fancy man.
768,1,0,ROZ,"Don't call him Littlefinger, he doesn't like it. Lord Baelish. As they enter a new room, a prostitute and two men with her get up to leave."
769,1,0,ROZ,She pretends she doesn't speak the common tongue so that people will think she's exotic. She grew up just down the road in flea bottom.
770,1,0,DAISY,She's beautiful.
771,1,0,ROZ,"She's a dumb slut, really, but a lid for every pot. (Janos enters the room). Lord Commander. Good to see you, again. Janos is followed by a number of gold cloaks, some of whom are dragging along a prisoner. Some leave to search other rooms."
772,1,0,ROZ,"You do realize this establishment is owned by Lord Petyr Baelish, the King's Master of Coin. Coin which goes in many pockets."
773,1,0,JANOS,Orders.
774,1,0,ROZ,Whose orders?
775,1,0,JANOS,Someone who doesn't care what Littlefinger thinks.
776,1,0,MHAEGAN,"No, you can't! Some gold cloaks force Mhaegan and her baby, Barra, into the room. She begins crying. The prisoner looks at Barra, and back to Janos. He then nods. A gold cloak lets go of the prisoner and takes the Barra from Mhaegan."
777,1,0,MHAEGAN,"No! Please! No! Not my Barra! Please. Please. The gold cloak holds a knife to the baby’s throat, hesitantly. Throughout the whole ordeal, Mhaegan continues begging for Barra’s life."
778,1,0,JANOS,"Enough. Get it done. Kill the bastard. After a moment, Janos takes out a knife and grabs the baby."
779,1,0,JANOS,"Give it here. Janos kills the baby just off screen, and Mhaegan shrieks. Janos and the other gold cloaks leave the brothel. EXT. A DOCK Some gold cloaks walk along a dock. They go up some stairs."
780,1,0,CLOAK,"Spread out! Search every house, every room. Look in every room. INT. A HOUSE Some gold cloaks burst into a house and kill the inhabitants. EXT. A DOCK Outside again, a gold cloak tosses a young boy into the water and proceeds to drown him. EXT. STREET Some gold cloaks hold back a large mob as a baby is carried away. A gold cloak looks on as the baby is presumably killed. INT. SMITHY Janos and a number of gold cloaks arrive at the smithy. A gold cloak is holding the blacksmith’s face near some hot coals."
781,1,0,BLACKSMITH,Gendry! His name is Gendry.
782,1,0,JANOS,Where is the bastard?
783,1,0,BLACKSMITH,"The Night's Watch! Please, stop!"
784,1,0,JANOS,Where?
785,1,0,BLACKSMITH,"They took him up the Kingsroad, heading north!"
786,1,0,JANOS,How will we know him?
787,1,0,BLACKSMITH,He's got a bull's head helmet. He made it himself.

815,1,1,JANOS,Where is the bastard?
816,1,1,BLACKSMITH,"The Night’s Watch! Heading North! Shot of Gendry, Arya, and their party on the road. END COLD OPEN TITLE SEQUENCE Water can be heard trickling down. The opening shot is of Arya, her back to the camera, sitting by a pool of water in the woods. She turns her head to the left. Then some leaves rustle, and she turns to the right. A horse whinnies, and she walks towards some other people. Many of them are gathering wood, and she joins in. Jaqen H’ghar, Rorge, and Biter watch her as she walks past their cage."
817,1,1,JAQEN,(Whispers) Boy. Arya looks up at the cage.
818,1,1,JAQEN,(Whispers) Lovely boy.
819,1,1,ARYA,(Stops walking). What do you want?
820,1,1,JAQEN,A man has a thirst. The man does not drink for a day and a night. A boy could make a friend.
821,1,1,ARYA,(Walks toward the cave). I have friends.
822,1,1,RORGE,Give us a beer. Before I skin you.
823,1,1,JAQEN,"A man does not choose his companions. These two, they have no courtesy. A man must ask forgiveness. (Pause). You're called Arry. (Arya nods).  This man has the honor to be Jaqen H'ghar. Once of the Free City of Lorath."
824,1,1,RORGE,"Hey, you little shit. Get us beer! Arya throws down the wood she was holding and looks at Rorge angrily."
825,1,1,ARYA,"You should have asked nicely. Arya begins hitting the cage with a stick, trying to hit Rorge. Rorge tries to claw back. Jaqen laughs at the exchange. Biter looks on."
826,1,1,RORGE,Come closer. And I'll shove that stick up your bunghole and fuck you bloody.
827,1,1,JAQEN,(Quietly) The boy has more courage than sense.
828,1,1,RORGE,Come here! Rorge reaches out at Arya. Gendry walks past holding wood. Arya joins him.
829,1,1,GENDRY,Yoren said none of us were should go near of those three.
830,1,1,RORGE,Come here!
831,1,1,ARYA,They don't scare me.
832,1,1,GENDRY,Hmm? Then you're stupid. They scare me. Two gold cloaks ride in on horseback. Gendry puts down the wood he was carrying.
833,1,1,ARYA,What are gold cloaks doing this far from King's Landing? Arya attempts to hide under some wood.
834,1,1,GENDRY,What are you doing?
835,1,1,ARYA,They're looking for me.
836,1,1,CLOAK,You're in command here?
837,1,1,YOREN,You're a long way from home.
838,1,1,CLOAK,I asked you a question.
839,1,1,YOREN,"Aye, you did. You asked without manners. And I chose not to answer."
840,1,1,CLOAK,"(Pulls out rolled up paper and hands it to Yoren). I have a royal warrant. For one of these gutter rats you're transporting. Gendry looks at Arya. Arya looks back, pursing her lips."
841,1,1,YOREN,"Well the thing is, (Hands back the paper), these gutter rats belong to the Night's Watch now. That puts them beyond the reach of kings and queens. The gold cloak tries to pull out his sword. Yoren quickly pulls out his dagger and puts it to the man’s leg."
842,1,1,YOREN,"It's a funny thing. People worry so much about their throats, they forget about what's down low. Now I sharpened this blade before breakfast. I could shave a spider's arse if I wanted to. Or, I could nick this artery in your leg and once it's nicked, there's no one around here who knows how to un-nick it. Yoren takes the gold cloak’s sword. The other gold cloak pulls his out."
843,1,1,YOREN,We'll just keep that. Good steel is always needed on the wall. Seems you have a choice. You can die here at this crossroads a long way from home. Or you can go back to your city and tell your masters you didn't find what you were looking for.
844,1,1,CLOAK,We're looking for a boy named Gendry. (Gendry and Arya look shocked). He carries a bull's head helmet. Anyone turning him over will earn the King's reward. We'll be back. With more men. (To Yoren) And I'll be taking your head home along with that bastard boy. The gold cloaks ride off. Gendry and Arya stands up. Everyone in the party turns to look at Gendry.
845,1,1,TO,"KING’S LANDING INT. RED KEEP Tyrion walks through a room and into a hallway, whistling. As he opens the door to his room, Shae laughs, and he stops whistling. Shae and Varys are sitting at a table. Varys stands up, and Tyrion looks at Shae, and closes the door."
846,1,1,VARYS,My lord.
847,1,1,SHAE,"You make me wait a long time, but your friend keeps me company."
848,1,1,VARYS,We were just speaking of your bravery in the victory against the Stark auxiliary forces.
849,1,1,TYRION,It was quite a battle. Tyrion walks over to the window to get some wine.
850,1,1,VARYS,I heard you suffered a terrible head wound. The northerners are such fearsome warriors.
851,1,1,SHAE,And I tell him the story of how we meet.
852,1,1,VARYS,To find so lovely creature working in your father's kitchen. It almost beggars belief.
853,1,1,TYRION,(Begins to pour wine). Strange things do happen. You should taste her fish pie.
854,1,1,SHAE,I don't think Lord Varys likes fish pie.
855,1,1,VARYS,How can you tell?
856,1,1,SHAE,I can always tell.
857,1,1,TYRION,Men like Lord Varys and I can't let our disadvantages get the best of us. We'll make a fisherman of him yet. (Takes a sip).
858,1,1,VARYS,"I am glad your new friend was able to accompany you to the capital. Friends are such an important part of life. Unfortunate that your father didn't want her to come. But rest easy my lord, I am very good at keeping secrets for my good friends."
859,1,1,TYRION,"Your discretion is legendary, where your friends are concerned."
860,1,1,VARYS,"How unspeakable of me to go on and on, when all you want to do is rest. I will leave you. (Kisses Shae’s hand). Welcome to Kings Landing, my dear. The city is made brighter by your presence. We have a council meeting, my lord. Shae stands up, and walks away. Tyrion puts his hand on the door, blocking it from being opened."
861,1,1,TYRION,I don't like threats.
862,1,1,VARYS,Who threatened you?
863,1,1,TYRION,I'm not Ned Stark. I understand the way this game is played.
864,1,1,VARYS,Ned Stark was a man of honor.
865,1,1,TYRION,And I am not. Threaten me again and I will have you thrown into the sea.
866,1,1,VARYS,"You might be disappointed in the results. The storms come and go. The big fish eat the little fish. And I keep on paddling. Come, my lord. We shouldn't keep the queen waiting. Tyrion opens the door. He and Varys exit. Varys closes the door behind them. INT. SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER The small council sits at their table. Alton stands nearby. Cersei is reading a letter aloud."
867,1,1,CERSEI,"“From this time until the end of time, we are not part of your realm, but a free and independent Kingdom of the North.” (Rips up the letter). He has more spirit than his father, I'll give him that."
868,1,1,TYRION,"You've perfected the art of tearing up papers. Give him his father's bones back, at least, as a gesture of good faith."
869,1,1,CERSEI,"You'll give the Starks our reply, cousin?"
870,1,1,ALTON,"I will, Your Grace."
871,1,1,CERSEI,Did you see my brother when you were the Starks guest? Varys and Baelish look annoyed.
872,1,1,ALTON,"I did. They have not broken his spirit, Your Grace."
873,1,1,CERSEI,"If you speak with him, tell him he's not been forgotten."
874,1,1,ALTON,"I will, Your Grace."
875,1,1,TYRION,"Safe travels, cousin. Alton leaves the room, followed by two gold cloaks."
876,1,1,TYRION,You have a deft hand with diplomacy.
877,1,1,CERSEI,If that's everything?
878,1,1,PYCELLE,"(Holding a letter). A raven flew in this morning from Castle Black. Pycelle hands the letter to Tyrion, who unfurls it and begins reading."
879,1,1,VARYS,Trouble with the wildlings?
880,1,1,BAELISH,That's why they're called wildlings.
881,1,1,VARYS,Somewhat less wild these days. It seems they've stopped killing each other and started following this King-Beyond-the-Wall.
882,1,1,CERSEI,"Another king? How many is that now, Five? I've lost count."
883,1,1,TYRION,Lord Commander asks that we send more men to man The Wall.
884,1,1,CERSEI,Perhaps he's forgotten we're fighting a war. We have no men to spare.
885,1,1,TYRION,"Cold winds are rising, and the dead rise with them."
886,1,1,PYCELLE,The northerners are a superstitious people. Everyone but Tyrion stands up to leave.
887,1,1,TYRION,"According to the Commander, one of these dead men attacked him in his chambers. (The other stop leaving). Mormont doesn't lie."
888,1,1,VARYS,How do you kill a dead man?
889,1,1,TYRION,Apparently you burn him.
890,1,1,CERSEI,"One trip to The Wall and you come back believing in grumpkins and snarks. (Walks away, followed by Varys)."
891,1,1,TYRION,"I don't know what I believe, but here's a fact for you. The Night's Watch is the only thing that separates us from what lies beyond the Wall."
892,1,1,CERSEI,I have every confidence the brave men of the Night's Watch will protect us all. Everyone but Tyrion leaves.
893,1,1,TO,"BEYOND THE WALL INT. CRASTER’S CAMP Sam, Edd, and Grenn are standing at a table. Edd and Grenn are cutting food."
894,1,1,EDD,"Then I said, if the gods wanted us to have dignity, wouldn't make us fart when we died."
895,1,1,GRENN,We fart when we die?
896,1,1,EDD,"My blessed mother was holding her own when she left this world. She farted so hard, the whole bed shook. Edd makes farting noises with his mouth as they continue to cut food. Sam looks up and watches Gilly walk past."
897,1,1,SAM,"Seems a bit greedy for one man to have so many wives. Wouldn't two, or three, be enough for him?"
898,1,1,EDD,We were having a serious discussion. Grenn looks up to watch some of the women.
899,1,1,GRENN,Would you look at that.
900,1,1,SAM,Nothing like the sight of a woman walking away.
901,1,1,GRENN,I prefer watching them come towards me.
902,1,1,SAM,I'm sure that's nice too.
903,1,1,GRENN,"Well, there was a milkmaid named Violet on the next farm over from where I grew up. And we were wrestling together from the time we were six years old. And then we got older, the wrestling, uh, (laughs), changed."
904,1,1,SAM,You were with her? How many times?
905,1,1,GRENN,"Well, as many times as I could."
906,1,1,SAM,Wish I'd grew up on a farm.
907,1,1,EDD,"We need more potatoes. And get another sack for the sludge. (Sam begins to walk away). Get the turnips too. As Sam continues walking, a dog barks. Then a woman screams. Sam turns around to see Gilly backed up against a fence post. Ghost stands in front of her, eyeing the meat she is carrying. Sam begins slowly walking over."
908,1,1,SAME,"No. Ghost, no. No. Ghost, away. Shoo. Shoo! (Ghost walks away). (To Gilly)  You all right? Did he frighten you? Sam reaches out to touch Gilly, but she flinches back."
909,1,1,GILLY,You shouldn't touch me.
910,1,1,SAM,"Oh, oh. Right. I'm sorry. I just wanted to make sure you weren't hurt. (Long pause)."
911,1,1,GILLY,You're very brave. The camera moves to a shot of Jon sharpening his sword. He stops and looks up as Sam and Gilly approach him.
912,1,1,JON,What’re you doing?
913,1,1,SAM,"This is Gilly, she's one of Craster's daughters."
914,1,1,JON,"Hello, Gilly. What’re you doing?"
915,1,1,GILLY,Sam said you could help.
916,1,1,JON,"I'm sorry, Sam knows we're not supposed to -"
917,1,1,SAM,"She's pregnant. (Gilly encourages Sam to continue). We have to take her with us, when we leave."
918,1,1,JON,What? (Stands up).
919,1,1,SAM,I know it sounds a bit mad.
920,1,1,JON,"No it doesn't sound a bit mad, it's impossible."
921,1,1,SAM,"The Lord Commander, (Jon tries and fails to interrupt Sam), we are sworn to protect -"
922,1,1,JON,Sam we can't take her -
923,1,1,GILLY,"Please sir, please. I can still run if I have to."
924,1,1,JON,It's just not possible.
925,1,1,GILLY,"I'm going to have a baby, if it's a boy I…"
926,1,1,JON,"If it's a boy what? (Gilly looks around and then down, not answering). You want us to risk our lives for you, and you won't even tell us why. Gilly looks taken aback, and then runs off."
927,1,1,SAM,Why did you do that?
928,1,1,JON,"Do what, ask her a question?"
929,1,1,SAM,You were cruel.
930,1,1,JON,Cruel! Sam are you in such a hurry to lose a hand?
931,1,1,SAM,I didn't touch her!
932,1,1,JON,No you just want to steal her. What do you think Craster cuts off for that?
933,1,1,SAM,"I can't steal her, she's a person not a goat."
934,1,1,JON,"We're heading deeper and deeper into wildling territory. We can't take a girl with us. Mormont wouldn't have it. And even if he would, what would we do with her? Who's gonna deliver her baby? You?"
935,1,1,SAM,"I could try. (Jon looks down, annoyed). What? I've read about it. A bit."
936,1,1,JON,"I'm sorry Sam, we can't help her. Jon sits back down, and returns to sharpening his sword. Sam walks away. When Sam is gone, Jon sighs deeply."
937,1,1,TO,"ESSOS EXT. DESERT The camera pans across Daenerys’s people, many of whom appear tired and weak. Jorah and Daenerys sit near each other. After looking out for a few moments, Jorah takes a sip of his water, and then sighs. Then a horse can be heard approaching. Jorah looks up at it, and it is shown to be riderless."
938,1,1,JORAH,"Khaleesi. Daenerys looks up at the horse. Jorah gets up. The horse is covered in red paint. Jorah walks over to it. A soaking wet sack is attached to it. Some hair can be seen poking out of the top. Flies can be heard buzzing. Jorah feels the hair, and Daenerys gets up from where she was sitting to approach the horse. Jorah pulls the object in the sack out a little bit by the hair, revealing it to be a human head. He then puts it back in the sack. Jorah picks up the ponytail of the head, which has been cut off."
939,1,1,JORAH,You don't need to see this.
940,1,1,DAENERYS,"He is blood of my blood. Daenerys looks in the sack, and then quickly looks away."
941,1,1,DAENERYS,Who did this?
942,1,1,JORAH,"Khal Pono perhaps, Khal Jhaqo They don't like the idea of a woman leading a Khalasaar."
943,1,1,DAENERYS,"They will like it far less when I'm done with them. Irri walks over and sees the head. She then falls to her knees, crying."
944,1,1,IRRI,"No! (Speaking Dothraki, to Daenerys) They killed his soul!"
945,1,1,DAENERYS,(Speaking Dothraki) Shh. They cannot kill his soul.
946,1,1,IRRI,(Speaking Dothraki) They did! They butchered him like an animal. They did not burn his body. (Daenerys kneels to Irri’s level). He can never join his ancestors in the night lands.
947,1,1,DAENERYS,"(Speaking Dothraki) Shh. We will build him a funeral pyre. Daenerys looks up at Jorah. Jorah looks down. Daenerys addresses Irri again, holding her head."
948,1,1,DAENERYS,"(Speaking Dothraki) And I promise you, Rakharo will ride with his ancestors tonight. Daenerys continues to comfort Irri as she cries. Irri wails loudly."
949,1,1,TO,"IRON ISLANDS EXT. BOAT Theon stands on a boat, looking out at the Iron Islands. He smiles. The camera then cuts to him below deck. A naked woman lies in his bed. He walks towards the windows."
950,1,1,WOMAN,Is it as you remember my lord?
951,1,1,THEON,(Removes his jacket). Looks smaller.
952,1,1,WOMAN,"Everything looks bigger when you're a child. I remember my father's cabin, felt like a palace when I was little. Now look at it."
953,1,1,THEON,(Removes more of his clothes). They'll be waiting for me on the docks.
954,1,1,WOMAN,Who will?
955,1,1,THEON,"Anyone who matters, (Takes off his shirt), this is a big day for them. They haven't had much to get excited about since I left. It's a hard place the Iron Islands always has been. It's cold and it's wet."
956,1,1,WOMAN,I love the cold and wet.
957,1,1,THEON,"They say hard places breed hard men, (Unbuttons his pants), and hard men rule the world."
958,1,1,WOMAN,Then you'll be king before long.
959,1,1,THEON,"(Kneels down). Try smiling with your lips closed. (She does). Hmm, better. Theon stands up and roughly pushes her back onto the bed."
960,1,1,WOMAN,My father doesn't trust you Iron islanders.
961,1,1,THEON,(Taking off his pants). I don't blame him.
962,1,1,WOMAN,"He says that you're all reavers and rapers. And that no matter how many women you have, you'll never be satis- The woman groans as they begin having sex."
963,1,1,THEON,"Quit talking about your father. He's right about us. Our wives from the Iron Islands, they're for breeding. That's not enough for us. That's why we take saltwives, from the women we capture."
964,1,1,WOMAN,Capture me! Take me with you when you go ashore. Make me your saltwife.
965,1,1,THEON,Your place is on this ship.
966,1,1,WOMAN,Not after you leave. Father will punish me. He'll call me a whore.
967,1,1,THEON,"I haven't paid you. Theon flips her over, and they continue having sex."
968,1,1,TO,"KING’S LANDING INT. BROTHEL A prostitute and a man are having sex. A man is watching them through a small hole, while he himself is getting a blowjob. He holds some keys in his hand, which are jingling as he pushes the prostitute’s head. Baelish, in turn, is watching this man. He hears a noise and turns around, then covers the hole he was watching through. A man emerges from another room. A woman can be heard crying from inside."
969,1,1,MAN,"I barely touched her. And you charge twice as much as every other brothel. And this is what I get, crying."
970,1,1,BAELISH,"One moment, my friend. A moment. Baelish snaps his fingers, and a woman emerges from another room, covered only in gold jewelry. Out of sight, Baelish wipes some semen from her face with a cloth, and then turns back to the disgruntled man."
971,1,1,BAELISH,"Please accept my sincerest apologies. Ramka will take good care of you. Upon seeing Ramka, the man smiles. As they begin to kiss passionately, Baelish goes to investigate the crying woman. He enters the room to see Roz, curled up on the bed, crying. He walks over to her, putting a hand on her back, and then sits next to her."
972,1,1,ROZ,"I’m sorry, my lord."
973,1,1,BAELISH,Shhh. Did he hurt you?
974,1,1,ROZ,"No, my lord… It’s Mhaegen."
975,1,1,BAELISH,Who?
976,1,1,ROZ,"She works for you. She's the one, the girl whose, they killed her baby."
977,1,1,BAELISH,"Ah, yes, that was poorly handled. Sometimes those with the most power have the least grace."
978,1,1,ROZ,"Can't stop thinking about it, I can't sleep. Her poor little baby."
979,1,1,BAELISH,"You know, you remind me of another girl. A lovely thing I once acquired from an Elysium pleasure house. Beautiful, like yourself, and intelligent as yourself. But she wasn't happy. She cried, often. I asked her why but, we didn't have the kind of rapport that you and I have. Yes, it was quite sad. Girls from Elysium pleasure houses are expensive. Extremely expensive. And this one wasn't making me any money. I hate bad investments. Really, I do. They haunt me. I had no idea how to make her happy, no idea how to mitigate my losses. A very wealthy patron, he offered me a tremendous amount of money to let him transform this lovely, sad girl. To use her in ways that never occur to most men. And you know what occurs to most men. I would not say he succeeded in making her happy but my losses were definitely mitigated. (Stands up). Take tonight off to mourn Mhaegen’s child. I’ll see you tomorrow. But you’ll be happy? (Roz nods and smiles). That makes me happy. INT. DINING ROOM"
980,1,1,PODRICK,"More wine? The scene begins zoomed in on Podrick pouring Janos a glass of wine. He then spills, and we see Tyrion and Janos sitting at a table."
981,1,1,JANOS,"Damn it, boy!"
982,1,1,PODRICK,"Apologies, my lord."
983,1,1,TYRION,"Leave us, Podrick. I believe we know how to pour our own wine."
984,1,1,JANOS,(Podrick leaves). Is that your new squire? Could have found you a proper lad.
985,1,1,TYRION,"Myself, I prefer the improper ones."
986,1,1,JANOS,"Hmm, that's a good red. Dornish?"
987,1,1,TYRION,"You know your wines, my lord."
988,1,1,JANOS,"That I do. A fine dinner, my lord."
989,1,1,TYRION,"Call me Tyrion, please. I'm sure you're getting used to fine dinners, now that you're a lord."
990,1,1,JANOS,Maybe I'll hire this cook of yours.
991,1,1,TYRION,Wars have been started for less. They both laugh. Janos sips his wine.
992,1,1,TYRION,I heard there was some trouble in Littlefinger's brothel the other night.
993,1,1,JANOS,"Hmm. Nasty business, had to be done."
994,1,1,TYRION,"Yes, of course. City Watch must keep the peace. Only, I hadn't realized peace depended on killing babies."
995,1,1,JANOS,Orders are orders.
996,1,1,TYRION,Quite right. Especially the queen's orders.
997,1,1,JANOS,I never said they were the queen's orders.
998,1,1,TYRION,"No, but who else would want to murder King Robert's bastards? She's always been a jealous woman."
999,1,1,JANOS,You know your sister better than I do.
1000,1,1,TYRION,You've heard the awful rumors about my brother and sister.
1001,1,1,JANOS,I don't listen to filth.
1002,1,1,TYRION,"That's good of you, but you have heard them. I suppose people who do believe that filth, consider Robert's bastards to be better claimants to the throne than Cersei's children."
1003,1,1,JANOS,"Joffrey is my king, the rest doesn't interest me. (Sips his wine)."
1004,1,1,TYRION,"I appreciate your loyalty. Tell me. When your men slaughtered Ned Stark's men in the throne room, did you give the order?"
1005,1,1,JANOS,I did. And I would again. The man was a traitor. He tried to buy my loyalty.
1006,1,1,TYRION,The fool! He had no idea you were already bought.
1007,1,1,JANOS,Are you drunk? I'll not have my honor questioned by an Imp.
1008,1,1,TYRION,"I'm not questioning your honor, Lord Janos. I'm denying its existence."
1009,1,1,JANOS,"You think I'll stand here and take this from you, dwarf."
1010,1,1,TYRION,"Dwarf? You should have stopped at imp. And yes, you will stand here and take it from me, unless you'd like to take it from my friend here. Tyrion gestures towards Bronn, who has appeared in the room."
1011,1,1,TYRION,"I intend to serve as Hand of the King until my father returns from the war, and seeing as you betrayed the last Hand of the King, well, I just wouldn't feel safe with you lurking about."
1012,1,1,JANOS,What are you ta- My friends at court will not allow this. The queen herself -
1013,1,1,TYRION,The queen regent. And you're a fool to believe she's your friend.
1014,1,1,JANOS,We shall hear what Joffrey has to say about this.
1015,1,1,TYRION,"No, we shan't. Tyrion nods at Bronn, who gestures for some armed men to enter the room."
1016,1,1,TYRION,"There's a ship leaving for East Watch by the sea tonight. From there, I'm afraid it's rather a long walk to Castle Black. I hope you enjoy the Wall. I found it surprisingly beautiful, in a brutal, horribly uncomfortable sort of way."
1017,1,1,BRONN,"The lads will escort you. The streets aren't safe at night, my lord."
1018,1,1,JANOS,These men are under my command. (Bronn laughs). I command you to arrest this cutthroat.
1019,1,1,TYRION,His name is Bronn... and he is the new commander of the City Watch.
1020,1,1,BRONN,Boys? The gold cloaks in the room escort Janos out. Janos begins shouting as they take him.
1021,1,1,JANOS,"I have friends at court! Powerful friends! The king himself made me a lord! Janos is escorted out of view. Bronn sits down, and Tyrion pours him a cup of wine."
1022,1,1,TYRION,To the new Commander. Tyrion and Bronn clink their glasses together. Then they both sip.
1023,1,1,TYRION,"If I told you to murder, an infant girl say, still at her mother's breast, would you do it without question?"
1024,1,1,BRONN,Without question? No. I'd ask how much.
1025,1,1,TO,"WOODS EXT. CAMP NEXT TO A RIVER Gendry gathers some water in a bucket. Lommy and Hot Pie sit next to the river, washing things. Arya sits away from them, doing the same."
1026,1,1,LOMMY,"If they come back, I say we yield. Gendry's the one they want. I don't want to get caught in the middle of a battle."
1027,1,1,PIE,I'm not afraid of no battles.
1028,1,1,ARYA,"If you got within a mile of a battle, you'd fill your pants."
1029,1,1,PIE,I've seen lots of battles. I saw -
1030,1,1,ARYA,Liar.
1031,1,1,PIE,I saw a man kill another man just outside a tavern in Flea Bottom. Stabbed him right in the neck.
1032,1,1,LOMMY,Two men fighting isn't a battle.
1033,1,1,PIE,They had armor on.
1034,1,1,ARYA,So?
1035,1,1,PIE,"So, if they got armor on, it's a battle."
1036,1,1,LOMMY,"No, it isn't."
1037,1,1,PIE,What's a dyer's apprentice know about battles anyway?
1038,1,1,ARYA,"(Gendry walks over to get more water). Gendry's an armorer's apprentice. Hot Pie, tell Gendry what makes it a battle."
1039,1,1,PIE,(Hesitates) It's when they've got armor on.
1040,1,1,GENDRY,Now who told you that.
1041,1,1,PIE,A knight?
1042,1,1,GENDRY,How'd you know he was a knight?
1043,1,1,PIE,"Well, cause he got armor on."
1044,1,1,GENDRY,You don't have to be a knight to have armor. Any idiot can buy armor. (Arya smiles).
1045,1,1,PIE,How'd you know?
1046,1,1,GENDRY,"‘Cause I sold armor. Lommy nudges Hot Pie, and they both get up and leave. Arya stops washing and stands up, walking over to Gendry."
1047,1,1,ARYA,What do the gold cloaks want with you?
1048,1,1,GENDRY,(Turning around) No idea.
1049,1,1,ARYA,You're a liar.
1050,1,1,GENDRY,(Walking to camp fire). You shouldn't insult people that are bigger than you.
1051,1,1,ARYA,Then I wouldn't get to insult anyone. (Follows him).
1052,1,1,GENDRY,"Well, I don’t care what any of them want. No good's ever come of their questions."
1053,1,1,ARYA,No good's ever come? Who asked questions before?
1054,1,1,GENDRY,How can someone so small be such a huge pain in my ass?
1055,1,1,ARYA,Who asked questions?
1056,1,1,GENDRY,"The Hand of the King. Er, hands of the King. Lord Arryn came first, a few weeks before he died. And then Lord Stark came, a few weeks before he died."
1057,1,1,ARYA,Lord Stark.
1058,1,1,GENDRY,See? Asking me questions is bad luck. (Walks back to river). You'll probably be dead soon.
1059,1,1,ARYA,What did they ask about?
1060,1,1,GENDRY,My mom.
1061,1,1,ARYA,Who's your mom?
1062,1,1,GENDRY,Just my mom. Worked in a tavern. Died when I was little.
1063,1,1,ARYA,And who was your father?
1064,1,1,GENDRY,"He could be one of those gold-hatted bastards, for all I know. What about you, anyway? You thought they were after you, why? Did you kill someone, or is it just because you're a girl?"
1065,1,1,ARYA,I'm not a girl!
1066,1,1,GENDRY,(Walks back to camp fire). Yes you are. You think I'm as stupid as the rest of them?
1067,1,1,ARYA,"Stupider. Night's Watch doesn't take girls, everyone knows that."
1068,1,1,GENDRY,That's true. You're still a girl.
1069,1,1,ARYA,I am not!
1070,1,1,GENDRY,"Well, pull your cock out and take a piss then."
1071,1,1,ARYA,I don't need to take a piss… Lommy and Hot Pie can’t know. No one can know.
1072,1,1,GENDRY,They won't. Not from me.
1073,1,1,ARYA,My name's not Arry. It's Arya. Of House Stark. Yoren is taking me home to Winterfell.
1074,1,1,GENDRY,He was your father. The Hand. The traitor.
1075,1,1,ARYA,He was never a traitor! Joffrey is a liar.
1076,1,1,GENDRY,"So you're a highborn, then. You're a lady."
1077,1,1,ARYA,"No. I mean yes. My mother was a lady, and my sister -"
1078,1,1,GENDRY,"You were a lord's daughter and you lived in a castle. Look, all that about cocks. I should never have said that. I've been pissing in front of you and everything. I should be calling you milady."
1079,1,1,ARYA,Do not call me milady.
1080,1,1,GENDRY,"As milady commands. (Arya pushes him). Well, that was unladylike. Arya pushes Gendry to the ground. He laughs, and she stomps off."
1081,1,1,TO,IRON ISLANDS EXT. DOCKS The scene starts with a wide shot of the busy docks. Theon stands in a rowboat as is comes up against the side of a wall. He gets out and walks up some stairs. An old man spots him.
1082,1,1,MAN,What you carrying?
1083,1,1,THEON,Pears and oranges. Wine from the Arbor. And the heir to Pyke of the Iron Islands. (The man makes no response). The only living son of Balon Greyjoy. (The man continues to make no response). Me.
1084,1,1,MAN,Don't like wine. Woman's drink. (Returns to his work).
1085,1,1,THEON,"I need to get to Pyke. The man looks up, but makes no move or response. Theon looks annoyed and pulls out some coins."
1086,1,1,MAN,I'll find you a horse. The man takes the coins and walks away. Theon watches as the rowboat that took him there leaves. He looks down.
1087,1,1,YARA,I'm heading that way. I can take you there.
1088,1,1,THEON,I bet you can.
1089,1,1,YARA,You been at sea long? Or were there just no women where you came from?
1090,1,1,THEON,None like you.
1091,1,1,YARA,You don't know what I'm like.
1092,1,1,THEON,You don't know what you're like. You need someone to teach you. Know who I am?
1093,1,1,YARA,You think I offer free rides to every man in jewelry. Lord Greyjoy. Yara and Theon pass the man as they are walking. He is leading a horse. Theon gives him some more coins.
1094,1,1,THEON,Have my things sent up to the castle. EXT. BEACH Yara and Theon ride on horseback on a beach. Yara is at the reins.
1095,1,1,THEON,"You should give me the reins, I'm a better rider than you. I've been on horseback for the last nine years."
1096,1,1,YARA,Nine years. Do you still know your way around a ship? Have these hands ever touched a rope?
1097,1,1,THEON,Don't you worry about my hands. (Theon begins fondling her). The sea's in my blood.
1098,1,1,YARA,Your blood will be in the sea if I don't watch where I'm going.
1099,1,1,THEON,"I have a proposal for my father. One that will make him king again. And me after him. You may stay at the castle tonight, if you're lucky."
1100,1,1,YARA,Is that an offer from my future king?
1101,1,1,THEON,"An order, from your future king. You can tell your grandchildren about this night."
1102,1,1,YARA,"I don't imagine it will be a story fit for children. As they approach the castle, the camera pans up to view it in its entirety. INT. INSIDE PYKE Balon sits in front of a fireplace. Theon enters the room."
1103,1,1,THEON,Father.
1104,1,1,BALON,"Nine years, is it? They took a frightened boy. What have they given back?"
1105,1,1,THEON,A man. Your blood and your heir.
1106,1,1,BALON,We shall see. Stark had you longer than I did.
1107,1,1,THEON,Lord Stark is gone.
1108,1,1,BALON,And how do you feel about that?
1109,1,1,THEON,What's done is done. I've brought you a proposal from Robb Stark.
1110,1,1,BALON,Who gave you those clothes? (Stands up).  Was it Ned Stark's pleasure to make you his daughter?
1111,1,1,THEON,"If my clothes offend you, I will change them."
1112,1,1,BALON,It will. (Begins walking forward). That bauble around your neck. Did you pay the iron price for it or the gold? (Theon looks down). I asked a question. Did you pull it from the neck of a corpse you made or did you buy it to match your fine clothes? Iron or gold?
1113,1,1,THEON,Gold. Balon reaches out and rips the bauble off. Theon’s cloak falls to the ground.
1114,1,1,BALON,I'll not have my son dressed as a whore. (Balon walks towards the fireplace and looks into it). My fears have come true. The Starks have made you theirs.
1115,1,1,THEON,(Steps forward). My blood is salt and iron.
1116,1,1,BALON,"Yet, (Turns around), the Stark boy sends you to me like a trained raven, clutching his message."
1117,1,1,THEON,"The offer he makes, is one I proposed."
1118,1,1,BALON,He heeds your counsel?
1119,1,1,THEON,"I've lived with him, hunted with him, fought at his side, he thinks of me as a brother."
1120,1,1,BALON,"No, not here, (Walks forward), not in my hearing, you will not name him brother. This son of the man who put your true brothers to the sword. Or have you forgotten your own blood?"
1121,1,1,THEON,I forget nothing. I remember my brothers. And I remember when my father was a king. Theon holds a letter out. Balon takes it and turns around. He then unfurls it and reads it.
1122,1,1,BALON,I see. I destroy Robb Stark's enemies for him and he will make me King of the Iron Islands once again.
1123,1,1,THEON,I will lead the attack myself.
1124,1,1,BALON,"Oh, you will?"
1125,1,1,THEON,"I'm your son. Your only living heir. Who else? Someone enters the room. Balon looks behind Theon, and he turns to look as well."
1126,1,1,THEON,I told you to wait outside. (The person who entered is revealed to be Yara). How did you get past the guards?
1127,1,1,YARA,Anything with a cock is easy to fool.
1128,1,1,BALON,(Puts his arm around her). My dear.
1129,1,1,THEON,Yara?
1130,1,1,YARA,"So good to see you, brother. This is a homecoming I'll tell my grandchildren about."
1131,1,1,THEON,She can't lead an attack!
1132,1,1,BALON,And why not?
1133,1,1,THEON,You're a woman!
1134,1,1,YARA,You're the one in skirts.
1135,1,1,BALON,"This isn't Winterfell, boy. Your sister took over command of your eldest brother's ship after your new father killed him."
1136,1,1,THREE,(Theon joins a little late). What's dead may never die. The only night she's spent off these islands has been spent on the sea. She's commanded men. She's killed men. She knows who she is. Balon leans down and burns the letter in the fire. Yara smirks at Theon.
1137,1,1,BALON,(Watching the letter burn in his hand). No man gives me a crown. I pay the iron price. I will take my crown. (Throws the letter in the fire). That is who I am. That is who we have always been. Balon walks away. Yara follows him. Theon turns around to watch them leave.
1138,1,1,THEON,You won't stand a chance against the Lannisters on your own.
1139,1,1,BALON,Who said anything about the Lannisters?
1140,1,1,TO,DRAGONSTONE EXT. BEACH Davos and Salladhor Saan walk on a beach. Matthos follows closely behind them..
1141,1,1,DAVOS,You'll have your gold when we take the treasury at King's Landing.
1142,1,1,SAAN,"All these kings fighting for the throne, and this Stannis has the smallest army. Why would I bet on the man with the worst chance?"
1143,1,1,DAVOS,"Because you're a smart gambler. Stannis has proved himself in war. Twice. His baby brother has never set foot on a battlefield. Neither has the false king, Joffrey."
1144,1,1,SAAN,"And yet, they both have larger armies."
1145,1,1,DAVOS,Stannis has just begun the fight. His bannermen will rally to his cause. There's no man in the Seven Kingdoms more honorable than Stannis Baratheon. Or more worthy of loyalty.
1146,1,1,SAAN,What is the world coming to when smugglers must vouch for the honor of kings.
1147,1,1,MATTHOS,"Mind your words, pirate. (They all stop walking)."
1148,1,1,DAVOS,Matthos.
1149,1,1,SAAN,You think I'm insulted? I am a pirate. I'm an excellent pirate. I don't sail for promises.
1150,1,1,DAVOS,"Of course you do. Every time you leave harbor, you're leaving on a promise. A promise that somewhere on the seas, somebody's got some gold and you can take it from them."
1151,1,1,SAAN,That's a promise that always comes true.
1152,1,1,DAVOS,"As is mine. You're not the young man, Salladhor. And correct me if I'm wrong: Most pirates don't grow old."
1153,1,1,SAAN,Only the clever ones.
1154,1,1,DAVOS,"You want to spend your last few years on the sea, stealing from Pentoshi cheesemongers and Midanese silk merchants, then go. They're out there waiting for you. That's easy. What I'm offering you is hard. Come with me and plunder the greatest city in Westeros. You'll be the richest man in Lysene. And the most famous. They'll be singing songs about you as long as men have voices to sing."
1155,1,1,SAAN,Salladhor Saan is a good name for songs.
1156,1,1,DAVOS,It is. (Matthos rolls his eyes).
1157,1,1,SAAN,"One thing, I want the queen."
1158,1,1,DAVOS,The queen?
1159,1,1,SAAN,"Cersei, I want her. I'll sail with your fleet, all 30 of my ships, and if we don't drown at the bottom of Blackwater Bay, I will fuck this blonde queen and I will fuck her well."
1160,1,1,MATTHOS,This war isn't about you. We're not attacking King's Landing so that you can rape the queen.
1161,1,1,SAAN,"I'm not going to rape her, I'm going to fuck her."
1162,1,1,MATTHOS,As if she would just let you!
1163,1,1,SAAN,You don't know how persuasive I am. I never tried to fuck you.
1164,1,1,MATTHOS,"Stannis is the rightful king, and the Lord of Light. The one true god."
1165,1,1,SAAN,"I've been all over the world, my boy, and everywhere I go, people tell me about the true god. They all think they found the right one. The one true god is what's between a woman's legs, and better yet a queen's legs. Matthos walks away angrily. Saan turns back to Davos."
1166,1,1,SAAN,I never thought you'd have a true believer for a son.
1167,1,1,DAVOS,He's young yet. I promise you the gold. I promise you the glory. I cannot promise you the queen.
1168,1,1,MATTHOS,You believe your king can win?
1169,1,1,DAVOS,He is the one true king.
1170,1,1,SAAN,"You Westerosee are funny people. A man chops off your fingers and you fall in love with him. (They laugh). I'll sail with you, Davos Seaworth. You are the most honest smuggler I ever met. Make me rich."
1171,1,1,DAVOS,Get me to the gates of King's Landing and I will. They shake hands. Davos pats Saan on the back as he walks away. Saan and Matthos eye each other as Saan walks past. Matthos walks back over to his father.
1172,1,1,MATTHOS,When will the King have a sail?
1173,1,1,DAVOS,As soon as his God wills it.
1174,1,1,MATTHOS,"He's my God too, and yours. But you were too blind to see. (As they walk). Let me teach you how to read."
1175,1,1,DAVOS,Oh you and your mother.
1176,1,1,MATTHOS,It won't take long. You already know the letters. The holy books are much more persuasive than I can be.
1177,1,1,DAVOS,"I wish I had a God, truly! I'm not mocking you, but I've seen men pray to every God there is. Pray for wind, pray for rain, pray for home. None of it works!"
1178,1,1,MATTHOS,But you always came home.
1179,1,1,DAVOS,I wasn't praying.
1180,1,1,MATTHOS,"(They reach their horses). But I was. Every night that you were at sea, I lit a candle and I prayed, for you."
1181,1,1,DAVOS,"You want me to have a god, fine. King Stannis is my god. He raised me up and blessed me with his trust. He gave you a future I could never have imagined. You know how to read, you'll be a knight someday. You think your fire god commanded all that? It was Stannis. Only Stannis."
1182,1,1,MATTHOS,"(As Davos is mounting his horse). Stannis is my king, but he's only a man."
1183,1,1,DAVOS,"Don't tell him that. Davos rides away and Matthos watches. In the background, Saan’s boat is in the water."
1184,1,1,TO,KING’S LANDING INT. TYRION’S ROOM Tyrion sits at a table with a cup of wine. Cersei paces in front of him.
1185,1,1,CERSEI,Lord Janos Slynt was Commander of the City Watch. You had no right to exile him.
1186,1,1,TYRION,I have every right. I am the King's Hand.
1187,1,1,CERSEI,You're serving as the King's Hand until father gets here. I am Queen Regent.
1188,1,1,TYRION,"Listen to me, Queen Regent, you're losing the people. Do you hear me?"
1189,1,1,CERSEI,"Ha, the people. You think I care?"
1190,1,1,TYRION,"You might find it difficult to rule over millions who want you dead. Half the city will starve when winter comes. The other half will plot to overthrow you. And your gold-plated thugs just gave them the rallying cry, “The Queen slaughters babies.” (Cersei says nothing). You don't even have the decency to deny it. Cersei looks down and walks toward the window. Tyrion looks down, and then up at her."
1191,1,1,TYRION,"It wasn't you who gave the order, was it? Joffrey didn't even tell you. Or did he tell you? I imagine that would be even worse."
1192,1,1,CERSEI,"He did what needed to be done. (Now loudly). You want to be the Hand of the King? You want to rule? This is what ruling is! Lying on a bed of weeds, ripping them out by the root one by one before they strangle you in your sleep."
1193,1,1,TYRION,"I'm no king, but I think there's more to ruling that that."
1194,1,1,CERSEI,"I don't care what you think! You've never taken it seriously. You haven't, Jaime hasn't. (Sits down). It's all fallen on me."
1195,1,1,TYRION,"(Tries not to laugh). As has Jaime repeatedly, according to Stannis Baratheon."
1196,1,1,CERSEI,"You're funny. (Laughs). You've always been funny. But none of your jokes will ever match the first one, will they? You remember... back when you ripped my mother open on your way out of her and she bled to death."
1197,1,1,TYRION,She was my mother too.
1198,1,1,CERSEI,"Now they're gone, for the sake of you. There's no bigger joke in the world than that. (Storms out)."
1199,1,1,TO,DRAGONSTONE INT. DRAGONSTONE KEEP Davos moves some ships around on a model map of Westeros as Matthos looks on. Stannis enters with Melisandre.
1200,1,1,DAVOS,Your Grace.
1201,1,1,MATTHOS,Your Grace.
1202,1,1,STANNIS,How did it fare with your pirate?
1203,1,1,DAVOS,Salladhor Saan will join our fleet. 30 ships. His men know how to fight.
1204,1,1,STANNIS,"In my experience, pirates prefer fighting unarmed men."
1205,1,1,DAVOS,Does seem the wiser choice.
1206,1,1,STANNIS,It won't be a choice this time. Do you trust him?
1207,1,1,DAVOS,"Salladhor Saan is an old friend, I've known him 30 years. I've never trusted him. But once he gets the smell of gold, he never stops."
1208,1,1,STANNIS,"Well if he does his job, he'll have his share. Leave us."
1209,1,1,DAVOS,"At once, Your Grace. Davos walks away, followed by Matthos. As Matthos passes her, Melisandre stops him."
1210,1,1,MELISANDRE,"The Lord of Light shines through you, young warrior. She then whispers something in his ear. When she is done, Matthos and Davos leave the room."
1211,1,1,DAVOS,Come.
1212,1,1,STANNIS,What did you say to him?
1213,1,1,MELISANDRE,I told him death by fire is the purest death.
1214,1,1,STANNIS,Why?
1215,1,1,MELISANDRE,Because it is true. You're troubled my king.
1216,1,1,STANNIS,Yeah.
1217,1,1,MELISANDRE,These armies are but toys for the Lord of Light.
1218,1,1,STANNIS,Tell your lord to burn them then.
1219,1,1,MELISANDRE,I tell him nothing! I pray for his commands and I obey.
1220,1,1,STANNIS,My little brother has a hundred thousand men according to the scouts. Men whose allegiance rightly belongs to me.
1221,1,1,MELISANDRE,You must have faith.
1222,1,1,STANNIS,"Faith? In a real war, the side with the greater number wins nine times out of ten."
1223,1,1,MELISANDRE,Then we must be the ten.
1224,1,1,STANNIS,"I cannot defeat my brother in the field, and I can't take King's Landing without the men he stole."
1225,1,1,MELISANDRE,"I have seen the path to victory in the flames. At first, you must give yourself to the Lord of Light."
1226,1,1,STANNIS,"I've said the words, damn you! I burnt the idols."
1227,1,1,MELISANDRE,You must give... all of yourself. Melisandre disrobes next to Stannis. He looks over and then looks away.
1228,1,1,STANNIS,I have a wife. I took a vow.
1229,1,1,MELISANDRE,"She's sick. Weak. Shut away in the tower. And she disgusts you. And she's given you nothing. No sons. Only stillborns. Only death. (Whispers in his ear). I will give you a son, my King."
1230,1,1,STANNIS,"(Gasps). A son? They begin kissing. Melisandre takes off what remained of her clothes. Stannis lays her on the table and they begin having sex, knocking many of the wooden models off of the table."
1231,1,2,DEFAULT,"What is Dead May Never Die Lyrics TITLE SEQUENCE CRASTER'S KEEP Craster pushes Jon Snow into his Keep, where the men of the Night's Watch have gathered."

1238,1,2,JON,Followed him. He took the baby into the woods - the newborn.
1239,1,2,JEOR,And what business is that of yours?
1240,1,2,JON,"You don't understand. He's killing them, all the boys -- you know."
1241,1,2,JEOR,The wildlings serve crueler gods than you and I. Those boys are his offerings.
1242,1,2,JON,Offerings? He's murdering his own children! He's a monster!
1243,1,2,JEOR,"Many times that monster's been the difference between life and death of our rangers. Your uncle among them. We have other wars to fight out there! Like it or not, we need men like Craster."

1246,1,2,SAM,Gilly.
1247,1,2,GILLY,You're leaving.
1248,1,2,SAM,I wanted to give you something. Belonged to my mother.
1249,1,2,GILLY,I can't take it.
1250,1,2,SAM,Please. I want you to. My mother used it for sewing. She let me sit with her in a chamber while she sewed and read to her. Father put a stop to it when he found out. It's the only thing I have of hers. She gave it to me before I left for the wall.

No one's made a Valyrian steel sword since the Doom of Valyria. There are three living smiths who know how to rework Valyrian steel. The finest of them was in Volantis. Came here to King's Landing at my invitation. Where did you get this much Valyrian steel? From someone who no longer had need of it. You've wanted one of these in the family for a long time. - And now we have two. - Two? The original weapon was absurdly large. Plenty of steel for two swords. Well, thank you. It's glorious. You'll have to train your left hand. Any decent swordsman knows how to use both hands. You'll never be as good. No. But as long as I'm better than everyone else, I suppose it doesn't matter. You can't serve in the Kingsguard with one hand. Where's that written? I can and I will. The Kingsguard oath is for life. The war is over. The king is safe. The king is never safe. How many people in this city alone would love to see his head on a pike? Other knights protected the king while you were a prisoner. They will continue to do so when you go home. - Home? - You'll return to Casterly Rock and rule in my stead. You are the Lord of Casterly Rock. I am the King's Hand. My place is here. I don't expect to see the Rock again before I die. You know what they call me? Kingslayer. Oathbreaker. Man without honor. Now you want me to break another sacred vow. You won't be breaking anything. There is a precedent to relieve a Kingsguard of his duties. The king will exercise that prerogative. - No. - No? No. I don't believe I asked you a question. There's my answer. If you think your bloody honor comes before... My bloody honor is beyond repair, but my answer is still no. I don't want Casterly Rock. I don't want a wife. I don't want children. What do you want? Supper would be nice. For 40 years I've tried to teach you. If you haven't learned by now, you never will. Go. If serving as a glorified bodyguard is the sum of your ambition, go serve. I suppose you want the sword back. Keep it. A one-handed man with no family needs all the help he can get. (GOATS BLEAT) How many Dornishmen does it take to fuck a goat? Please don't."

A crowned skull, the Manwoodys of Kingsgrave. Boy knows his Dornish Houses. I need a sigil. And House Martell, a red sun pierced by a spear? I don't see it, my lord. Well met, my lords. His Grace King Joffrey welcomes you in his name. My lord father, the King's Hand, sends his greetings as well. I am Tyrion Lannister of Casterly Rock, Master of Coin. Forgive me. I don't see Prince Doran in your company. The prince's health forces him to remain at Sunspear. He sends his brother Prince Oberyn to attend the royal wedding in his stead. Yes, the king will be delighted to enjoy the company of a warrior as renowned as Prince Oberyn at his wedding feast. Will he? And where is Prince Oberyn? Arrived before dawn. Not a man for welcome parties, our prince. Very well. My lords, these fine men from the City Watch will escort you to your quarters in the Red Keep. You must be weary after such a long journey. Some accomplished diplomacy that was. Now where? We must find Prince Oberyn before he kills somebody or several somebodies. How do you plan on finding a single Dornishman in a city this big? You're famous for fucking half of Westeros. You just arrived at the capital after two weeks of bad roads, where would you go? I'd probably go to sleep, but I'm getting old. Look at this one. How lovely is she? Beautiful. But pale. They like them pale in the capital. Shows they don't work the fields. Do I frighten you? You like? Timid. Timid bores me. You're a bit of mischief, aren't you? I think she likes you. She has good taste. You're not timid, are you? (IAUGHS) Not timid. Do you like women? When they look like her, my lord. This one will do nicely."

A procurer. Any of the others? The two girls can leave. - (SNAPS FINGERS) - You stay. I'm afraid I'm not an offer, my lord. Everyone who works for Littlefinger is an offer. Take off your clothes. We'll be here a while. - My lord. - I am a prince, boy. Have you ever been with a prince? Can't say I have. I'm wildly expensive. Take off your clothes. Which way do you like it? - (GASPS) - My way."

Sirs, if you follow me, I'll arrange for a private room. Why are you wasting a woman like this on a Dornishman? Bring him a shaved goat and a bottle of olive oil. (IAUGHS) Do you know why all the world hates a Lannister? You think your gold and your lions and your gold lions make you better than everyone. May I tell you a secret? You're not a golden lion. You're just a pink little man who is far too slow on the draw. (SCREAMS) Longsword is a bad option in close quarters. When I pull my blade, your friend starts bleeding. Quite a lot, I'm afraid. So many veins in the wrist. (GROANS) He'll live if you get him help straightaway. So, decisions. Prince Oberyn, forgive the intrusion. - We heard there might be... - (SCREAMS) trouble. Apologies, my love. I'm here to welcome you to the capital. Ellaria Sand, my paramour. The king's own Uncle Imp. Tyrion, son of Tywin Lannister. If there's anything I can do to make your stay... What are you? His hired killer? It started that way, aye. Now I'm a knight. How did that come to pass? Killed the right people, I suppose. (IAUGHS) We'll need a few more girls. Girls, yes? You don't partake? Oh, I partook. Now I'm married. Prince Oberyn, if I may, a word in private? Seems I visited the Lannister brothel by mistake. - Oh, they take all kinds. - Even Dornishmen. The king is very grateful that you traveled all this way for his wedding. Let us speak truth here. Joffrey is insulted. I am only the second son after all. Well, speaking as a fellow second son, I have grown rather used to being the family insult. (CHUCKLES) Why did you come to King's Landing, Prince Oberyn? I was invited to the royal wedding. I thought we were speaking truth. The last time I was in the capital was many years ago. Another wedding. My sister Elia and Rhaegar Targaryen, the Last Dragon. My sister loved him. She bore his children. Swaddled them, rocked them, fed them at her own breast. Elia wouldn't let the wet nurse touch them. And beautiful, noble Rhaegar Targaryen left her for another woman. That started a war and the war ended right here when your father's army took the city... I wasn't actually present. And butchered those children. My nephew and niece. Carved them up and wrapped them in Lannister cloaks. And my sister, you know what they did to her? I'm asking you a question. I've heard rumors. (CHUCKLES) So have I. The one I keep hearing is that Gregor Clegane the Mountain raped Elia and split her in half with his great sword. I wasn't there. I don't know what happened. If the Mountain killed my sister, your father gave the order. Tell your father I'm here. And tell him the Lannisters aren't the only ones who pay their debts.

What's the prize to winning this stupid contest? The honor of riding by your side on the road to Meereen. That honor goes to Ser Jorah and Ser Barristan as neither of them kept me waiting this morning. You two will ride in the rear guard and protect the livestock. The last man holding his sword can find a new queen to fight for. (DAARIO GROANS) You need to eat something. Pigeon pie. No, thank you. Lemon cakes? No, thank you. You love lemon cakes. Tell her she needs to eat. My lady, you do need to eat. I don't need to eat. If I could have a moment alone with my wife. She needs to eat. I can't let you starve. I swore to protect you. My lady, I am your husband. Let me help you. How can you help me? I don't know, but I can try. I lie awake all night staring at the canopy thinking about how they died. I could get you essence of nightshade to help you sleep. Do you know what they did to my brother? How they sewed his direwolf's head onto his body? And my mother. They say they cut her throat to the bone and threw her body in the river. What happened to your family was a terrible crime. I didn't know your brother. He seemed like a good man, but I didn't know him. Your mother, on the other hand, I admired her. She wanted to have me executed, but I admired her. She was a strong woman. And she was fierce when it came to protecting her children. Sansa. Your mother would want you to carry on. You know it's true. Will you pardon me, my lord? I'd like to visit the godswood. Of course. Of course. Prayer can be helpful, I hear. I don't pray anymore. It's the only place I can go where people don't talk to me. My lion. What are you doing? What does it look like I'm doing? Come here. How many times have I told you? You can't visit me here. I know. I know. We have come to a dangerous place. Have you forgotten me? Do you know how long it's been? Of course I haven't forgotten. I want you. Don't you want me? Things are a bit tense right now. What things? My nephew the king wants to murder me. My wife hates me because my father murdered her family. Oberyn Martell wants to murder everyone whose last name is Lannister. You need to relax. Don't you want to relax? - What's wrong? - I told you. - It's not a good time. - It's never a good time. - You have your child bride now. - Shae. - Do you love her? - Love her? I barely know her. She's a child. - She despises me. - That's not an answer. Of course I don't love her. You tried to ship me away. Ship you away? Give me diamonds and make me disappear. What in the world are you talking about? If you want me to leave, just say it. - Say it! - Shh. I don't know what you're talking about. You want me to stay? (GROANS) A work of art, really. The craftsmanship is excellent. You like it so much, you're welcome to chop off your own hand and take it. Such an ingrate. I spent days with the goldsmith - getting the details just right. - Days? Better part of an afternoon. There, how does that feel? Uh... a hook would be more practical. Elegant, I think. Thank you for your help with the other matter. - The symptoms have abated? - Gone completely. I am in your debt, Maester Qyburn. Not a maester, Your Grace, but happy to help whenever I can. Odd little man. - I've grown rather fond of him. - (DOOR CLOSES) He's quite talented, you know? What symptoms? Symptoms that are not your concern. You let him touch you? You jealous? I'm surprised. You never let Pycelle near you. (IAUGHS) You think I'd let that old lecher put his hands on me? He smells like a dead cat. I'm not sure I've ever smelled a dead cat. Well, they smell like Pycelle. You drink more than you used to. - Yes. - Why? Let's see, you started a brawl in the streets with Ned Stark and disappeared from the capital. My husband died in a tragic hunting accident. It must have been traumatic for you. My only daughter was shipped off to Dorne. We suffered through a siege. A rather short siege. A rather short siege that I didn't expect to survive. And now I'm marrying my eldest son to a wicked little bitch from Highgarden while I'm supposed to marry her brother, a renowned pillow biter. So... Father disowned me today. He can't disown you. You're all he's got. You're forgetting Tyrion. You don't really plan on staying in the Kingsguard, do you? Staying in the Kingsguard means I live right here in the Red Keep with you. - Not now. - I want... Not now? When? I've been back for weeks. - Something's changed. - Everything's changed. You come back after all this time with no apologies and one hand and expect everything to be the same? What do you want me to apologize for? For leaving me. You think I wanted to be taken prisoner? Don't know what you wanted. You weren't here. You left me alone. Every day I was a prisoner, I plotted my escape. Every day. I murdered people so I could be here with you. - You took too long. - I... - What are you saying? - I'm saying you took too long. (KNOCKING)"

Do you plan on sitting here scratching your balls till winter? We wait for Mance's orders. You sent a man over the Wall at the full moon. If he's not back yet, he's not coming back. And what is it you want? March on Castle Black with just this lot? Your pretty crow said 1,000 men are nesting there. Yeah, well, he's a liar. He is? Shouldn't it be ""he was""? You said you put three arrows in him. I did. I've seen you slip a shaft through a rabbit's eye at 200 yards. If that boy's still walking, it's 'cause you let him go. (WHISTLES) Thenns. I fucking hate Thenns. Mance sent you? - (GRUNTS) - How did you find us? You came from the south, not the north. Took a detour. Got some supper from a village down that way. Why does the meat down here taste so much better than it does on our side of the Wall? Help yourself. (CHUCKLES) Maybe everything's just better fed down here. Fat and lazy. Easier for us, hmm? You didn't see us coming? Lost your warg? And that baby crow you had with you, lost him too? I'll answer to Mance. I won't answer to you. She yours? I'm not anybody's. Too scrawny. Not like those crows at Castle Black. Think of them stuck in their larders stuffing their faces with ham and blood sausage and stew, getting nice and fat and marbled.

I wanted to hate him, but I never could. Sometimes I want to hate you. Well, you're better than me at everything. Except reading. They're... they're ready for you. He's wanted to hang me for a while.

The Halfhand believed our only chance to stop Mance was to get a man inside his army. Don't talk about the Halfhand as if you knew him. He was my brother. Then you'd know he'd do anything to defend the Wall. The free folk would have boiled him alive, but letting me kill him..."

I laid with a wildling girl. You admit to breaking your vows, then? I do. The law is the law. The boy must die. If we beheaded every ranger who lay with a girl, the Wall would be manned by headless men. There's a difference between sneaking off to the Mole's Town brothel and sleeping with the enemy. While we sit here debating which rules I broke, Mance Rayder marches on the Wall with an army of 100,000. Impossible. You can't get 50 wildlings together before they start killing each other. 100,000. He's united the Thenns, the Hornfoots, the ice-river clans. He has giants fighting for him. (IAUGHS) Giants? Have you ever been beyond the Wall, ser? I commanded the City Watch of King's Landing, boy. And now you're here. You must not have been very good at your job. How dare you?! There's a band of wildlings south of the Wall already led by Tormund Giantsbane. I killed their warg and three others. They shot me full of arrows. Their orders are to attack Castle Black from the south when Mance hits it from the north. The signal for the attack will be a bonfire. Mance said it would be the greatest fire the North has ever seen. That's the truth. All the truth. Do you intend to execute me or am I free to go? None of us are free. We are men of the Night's Watch. But we won't be taking your head today, Jon Snow. Go on. I am acting commander here, Maester Aemon. Yes, you are. And I don't trust the bastard. He told the truth.

Would you like to walk at the back of the train instead of riding? And this one's called lady's lace. Would you like to walk without shoes? You have to know a land to rule it.

1318,2,7,DANY,"Well, I don't see why it matters. Grey worm isn't interested, none of the unsullied care what's under our clothes."
1319,2,7,MISSANDEI,He was interested.
1320,2,7,DANY,What?
1321,2,7,MISSANDEI,I believe he was interested.
1322,2,7,DANY,"When the slavers castrate the boys, do they take all of it?"
1323,2,7,MISSANDEI,All of it?
1324,2,7,DANY,The...the pillar an the stones.
1325,2,7,MISSANDEI,"I don't know, your grace."
1326,2,7,DANY,Haven't you ever wondered?
1327,2,7,MISSANDEI,"Yes, your grace."
1328,2,7,SCENE,[Missandei is seen walking up toward Dany's throne. Grey Worm enters]
1329,2,7,WORM,Missandei. *in Valyrian* I have come to apologize.
1330,2,7,MISSANDEI,*in Valyrian* You don't need to apologize.
1331,2,7,WORM,*in Valyrian* I hope I didn't frighten you.
1332,2,7,MISSANDEI,*in Valyrian* No.
1333,2,7,WORM,"The lessons you give I in Common tongue, these are precious to I."
1334,2,7,MISSANDEI,To me.
1335,2,7,WORM,To me.
1336,2,7,MISSANDEI,I don't remember teaching you the word precious.
1337,2,7,WORM,"Jorah the Andal, he teaches I...he teaches me this word."
1338,2,7,MISSANDEI,Do you remember the name you were given at birth?
1339,2,7,WORM,I remember nothing. Only unsullied.
1340,2,7,MISSANDEI,"When they cut you, do you remember that?"
1341,2,7,SCENE,[Grey Worm shakes his head no]
1342,2,7,MISSANDEI,I'm sorry. I'm sorry they did that to you.
1343,2,7,WORM,Why? Why sorry?
1344,2,7,MISSANDEI,It's a terrible thing to do to a boy.
1345,2,7,WORM,"*approaches Missandei* If the masters never cut me, I am never unsullied. I never stand in the Plaza of Pride when Daenerys Stormborn orders us to kill the masters. I never am chosen to lead the unsullied. I never meet Missandei from the Island of Naath. I am sorry I...for today. I am sorry."
1346,2,7,SCENE,[Grey Worm turns around and begins to walk away]
1347,2,7,MISSANDEI,*in Valyrian* Grey Worm.
1348,2,7,SCENE,[Grey Worm stops and turns around]
1349,2,7,MISSANDEI,*in Valyrian* I'm glad you saw me.
1350,2,7,WORM,*in Valyrian* So am I.
1351,2,7,SCENE,[Grey Worm turns and walks out of the throne room]
1352,2,7,TO,MOAT CAILIN
1353,2,7,RAMSAY,"Bracken. Mmm, strong. As long as they're in the see. But when you take them out of the water, no bones. They collapse under their proud weight and slum into a heap of nothing. You'd think they'd know that. Unfortunately they're not very bright. What do you tell them?"
1354,2,7,THEON,"I'm Theon Greyjoy, son of Balon, heir to the Iron Islands."
1355,2,7,RAMSAY,And what are you really?
1356,2,7,THEON,I'm Reek.
1357,2,7,RAMSAY,"Are you sure? You do look very much like a lord. Formidable, proud."
1358,2,7,THEON,I'm Reek.
1359,2,7,RAMSAY,Until when?
1360,2,7,THEON,Always. Forever.
1361,2,7,RAMSAY,That's right. Until you're rotting in the ground. Remember what you are and what you're not. Bring me Lord Kenning.
1362,2,7,SCENE,[Theon approaches the castle on horseback] GUARD 1: *to Theon* No closer. Who are you?
1363,2,7,SCENE,[Theon enters the castle walls. Inside a lot of people are sick or dying]
1364,2,7,RALF,"I'm Kenning, commander of this garrison. And you say you're Theon Greyjoy?"
1365,2,7,THEON,Yes.
1366,2,7,RALF,And why should I believe that?
1367,2,7,THEON,I was born on Pike to Balon Greyjoy. His third and last-living son. I am your prince. I swear it by the drowned god. What is dead may never die.
1368,2,7,EVERYONE,What is dead may never die.
1369,2,7,RALF,"And if you were my prince, why are you marching with a Bolton army?"
1370,2,7,THEON,Lord Bolton took me captive after Winterfell. He sent me to treat with you in good faith as your fellow Ironborn.
1371,2,7,RALF,And what does Lord Bolton want?
1372,2,7,SCENE,[Theon hands Kenning a scroll]
1373,2,7,THEON,You are fading from sickness. You are badly outnumbered and you're hundreds of miles from the sea. Lord Bolton implores you to protect your men and abandon this fortress you can no longer hold. Do this and he will be just and fair with you as he is being with me. The Boltons will give you safe passage to the stony shore.
1374,2,7,RALF,He wants us to surrender?
1375,2,7,THEON,"My own father, your king, surrendered years ago to Robert Baratheon. I watched him bend the knee. There was no shame there. He fought with honor, as did you."
1376,2,7,SCENE,[Kenning falls to the ground. His men pick him up]
1377,2,7,RALF,...shame fought with honor.
1378,2,7,THEON,"I'm sorry, I didn't hear..."
1379,2,7,SCENE,[Kenning spits blood in Theon's face]
1380,2,7,RALF,No shame fought with honor. Only a whipped dog would speak this way. Or a woman. Are you a woman boy?
1381,2,7,THEON,*scared* You don't know.
1382,2,7,RALF,The Ironborn will not surrender.
1383,2,7,THEON,*whispering* Reek. Reek.
1384,2,7,RALF,"You go tell your master that, Theon Greyjoy. Or whoever the fuck you are. What in the hell are you muttering?"
1385,2,7,SCENE,[MAN 4 kills Kenning with an axe]
1386,2,7,THEON,"Reek. MAN 4: If we yield, we live? Is that what it says on this paper here?"
1387,2,7,THEON,Yes. Have your men raise the white flag and open the gates. You're going home.
1388,2,7,SCENE,[Cut to MAN 4's body with no skin and his eye cut out]
1389,2,7,RAMSAY,"You didn't really think I'd let them go did you? It's falling out of fashion. Fileting. Sad, but true. Traditions are important. Where are we without our history, eh?"
1390,2,7,THEON,Yes m'lord. Will we go home now?
1391,2,7,RAMSAY,I believe we will. To our new home.
1392,2,7,TO,"THE VALE You have foreign blood, don't you, Baelish?"
1393,2,7,PETYR,"A great-grandfather from Braavos, yes. I suppose all of our ancestors came from somewhere else originally."
1394,2,7,ROYCE,Our forebearers settled the Vale thousands of years ago. We've fought off invaders ever since.
1395,2,7,PETYR,"The beauty of the Vale is matched only by the nobility of its great families. Lady Arryn often told me that you were her rock, Lord Royce."
1396,2,7,ROYCE,"She told me nothing about you, Baelish. But I didn't need to hear from her. Moneylender. Whoremonger. You've been licking Tywin Lannister's boots so long, it's a wonder your tongue's not black."
1397,2,7,PETYR,My lord...
1398,2,7,ROYCE,"And when Jon Arryn named you Master of Coin, no one cared. Always been a grubby job. Why not let a grubby man do it? But when I heard you were lurking here, fawning over the Lady Arryn..."
1399,2,7,PETYR,Lady Arryn invited me. She and I have been close since childhood.
1400,2,7,ANYA,"Yes, we all know how close you were. Lady Arryn's predilections were her own affair. Her death is our affair."
1401,2,7,PETYR,Of course. Her suicide shattered us all.
1402,2,7,ANYA,She was an odd fish. Everyone knew that. But suicide? She adored that boy of hers. I don't see her abandoning him. Not by choice.
1403,2,7,ROYCE,"Strange that within days of your arrival, you've married Lady Arryn and she's fallen through the Moon Door."
1404,2,7,PETYR,She was always prone to melancholy. My lady wasn't meant for a world as brutal as ours.
1405,2,7,ROYCE,We were told there was a witness. A girl.
1406,2,7,ANYA,"A niece of yours, I believe."
1407,2,7,PETYR,"A girl with no learning and scattered wits. I assure you, she would be of no help."
1408,2,7,ROYCE,We'd like to speak with her.
1409,2,7,PETYR,Let me fetch her.
1410,2,7,ANYA,No need. We prefer to hear her testimony unadulterated.
1411,2,7,SCENE,[Sansa Stark enters the room]
1412,2,7,ANYA,"Come closer, child. You have nothing to fear from us or him. Lord Baelish here is your uncle? Your name is Alayne? Perhaps you would feel more comfortable if Lord Baelish left the room."
1413,2,7,PETYR,My lady...
1414,2,7,ANYA,I wasn't asking you.
1415,2,7,SANSA,He can stay.
1416,2,7,ROYCE,"Speak up, girl, you're not a damn kitchen mouse. Tell us what you saw."
1417,2,7,SANSA,"*to Petyr* I'm sorry, Lord Baelish. I have to tell the truth. *to the council* I'll tell you everything."
1418,2,7,ANYA,"Please, Alayne, leave nothing out."
1419,2,7,SANSA,"My name is not Alayne. It's Sansa Stark, eldest daughter of Lord Eddard Stark. Lord Royce, we met when you came to Winterfell. You were escorting your son Ser Waymar to the Wall."
1420,2,7,ROYCE,"Sansa Stark? You tell lies right to my face, you little worm?"
1421,2,7,SANSA,"Lord Baelish has told many lies. All to protect me. Since my father was executed, I have been a hostage in King's Landing. A plaything for Joffrey to torture or Queen Cersei to torment. They beat me, they humiliated me, they married me to the Imp. I had no friends in King's Landing...except one. He saved me. Smuggled me away when he had the chance. He knew I'd be safe here in the Eyrie with my own blood, my Aunt Lysa. The Lannisters have friends everywhere. Even the Vale. He made me swear not to tell anyone my true name."
1422,2,7,VANCE,"Your secret is safe with us, my lady."
1423,2,7,ROYCE,Your father grew up right here in these halls. We hunted together many times. He was a fine man.
1424,2,7,ANYA,"Tell us what happened to your aunt, Sansa."
1425,2,7,SANSA,"You knew her well, my lords, my lady. You knew she was a troubled woman. She always loved Lord Baelish. She told me herself. From the moment he arrived at the gates of Riverrun, a boy of eight carrying everything he owned in a little sack. She confessed to me she never loved Lord Arryn. She did as her father commanded, as so many of us have. When the gods finally allowed her to be with Lord Baelish, she was so happy. For a time. My aunt was a jealous lady. She was terrified that Lord Baelish didn't love her anymore. That he would abandon her for a younger woman. And then...one day she saw him kiss me."
1426,2,7,ROYCE,Lady Sansa.
1427,2,7,SANSA,"It was a peck on the cheek, Lord Royce, nothing more. Lord Baelish is my uncle now, in truth, by marriage. He's always been so kind to me. I was so happy to be here, to be free. All because of him. But my aunt turned on me. She cursed me. Called me a whore. Promised to throw me through the Moon Door. When Lord Baelish tried to calm her, she struck him. She said she didn't want to live anymore. She stood on the edge of that Moon Door. He tried to reason with her. Promised her she was the only one he had ever loved, but she stepped through those doors and she was...*begins sobbing*"
1428,2,7,ANYA,"Shh. Shh, it's not your fault, sweet girl. It's not your fault."
1429,2,7,SCENE,[Sansa looks up at Petyr]
1430,2,7,SCENE,"[Lord Royce, Lady Anya, and Petyr walk down the stairs]"
1431,2,7,ROYCE,You could see it in the way she raised that boy. Feeding him from her own teats when he was 10 years old.
1432,2,7,ANYA,Lord Royce! This is hardly the time.
1433,2,7,ROYCE,"Apologies, my lady. And to you as well, Baelish. We treated you a bit harshly."
1434,2,7,PETYR,"You want justice, Lord Royce. I can hardly complain about that. I want the same."
1435,2,7,ANYA,"Not much justice to be meted out in suicide, is there?"
1436,2,7,PETYR,"For Lysa, no. But for her son? Only 20 years ago, the knights of the Vale rode behind Jon Arryn, Ned Stark, Robert Baratheon. They fought together to overcome the Mad King. And since then, Arryn and Royce, Corbray, Waynwood, all the great houses of the Vale watched from the corner. A timid boy at a tavern brawl."
1437,2,7,ROYCE,Are you questioning our courage?
1438,2,7,PETYR,"I want to know which side you're on. Do you support the Lannisters, the house that executed your friend Ned Stark?"
1439,2,7,ROYCE,Of course we don't support the damn Lannisters.
1440,2,7,PETYR,"No? Catelyn Stark begged her sister for support and Lysa refused. By staying out of the fray, you've allowed Tywin Lannister to destroy his rivals on every compass point. Who stands against him now?"
1441,2,7,ANYA,"Who would you have us back, Lord Baelish? Robb Stark is dead."
1442,2,7,PETYR,"I'd have you back Robin Arryn, Lord of the Vale."
1443,2,7,ANYA,Robin Arryn is a sickly little boy.
1444,2,7,PETYR,And sickly little boys sometimes become powerful men.
1445,2,7,ANYA,More often they die young.
1446,2,7,PETYR,"I adored Lysa with all my heart. But she loved her son so much, she became overprotective. He needs to learn how to swing a sword. How to ride a horse."
1447,2,7,ROYCE,"Aye, it's time."
1448,2,7,PETYR,"Yes, it's time. Time for him to tour the Vale, to visit all the castles in his domain. Time for Robin to leave the nest."
1449,2,7,TO,MEEREEN
1450,2,7,BOY,Ser Barristan.
1451,2,7,BARRISTAN,Yes? Who sent you?
1452,2,7,SCENE,[A boy hands a scroll to Ser Barristan. He reads it]
1453,2,7,SCENE,[Ser Jorah is looking at a map by the water alone]
1454,2,7,JORAH,Ser Barristan.
1455,2,7,BARRISTAN,Ser Jorah.
1456,2,7,JORAH,Have I forgotten a council meeting?
1457,2,7,BARRISTAN,No.
1458,2,7,SCENE,[Ser Barristan hands Ser Jorah the scroll]
1459,2,7,JORAH,What's this?
1460,2,7,BARRISTAN,A royal pardon signed by Robert Baratheon. You spied on her.
1461,2,7,JORAH,Who gave you this?
1462,2,7,BARRISTAN,Does it matter?
1463,2,7,JORAH,Have you told her?
1464,2,7,BARRISTAN,"I wanted to tell you first, man-to-man rather than go behind your back."
1465,2,7,JORAH,Let me speak with her in private.
1466,2,7,BARRISTAN,You'll never be alone with her again.
1467,2,7,SCENE,[Ser Barristan leaves]
1468,2,7,SCENE,"[Ser Jorah enters Dany's throne room, walking toward her]"
1469,2,7,DANY,Why did the usurper pardon you?
1470,2,7,JORAH,If we could speak alone.
1471,2,7,DANY,"No, speak to me here. Explain it to me."
1472,2,7,JORAH,"Who do you think sent this to Meereen? Who profits? This is the work of Tywin Lannister. He wants to divide us. If we're fighting each other, we're not fighting him."
1473,2,7,DANY,The pardon was signed the year we met. Why were you pardoned? Unless you're saying this document was forged.
1474,2,7,JORAH,It is not forged.
1475,2,7,DANY,"Why, then?"
1476,2,7,JORAH,"I sent letters to Varys, the spymaster of King's Landing."
1477,2,7,DANY,What was the content of these letters?
1478,2,7,JORAH,Information.
1479,2,7,DANY,What information?
1480,2,7,JORAH,When you and Viserys arrived in Pentos. His plan to marry you to Khal Drogo. When you were married. When your brother died.
1481,2,7,DANY,You told him I was carrying Drogo's child?
1482,2,7,JORAH,I...
1483,2,7,DANY,Yes or no?
1484,2,7,JORAH,Khaleesi.
1485,2,7,DANY,Don't call me that. Did you tell him I was carrying Drogo's child?
1486,2,7,JORAH,Yes.
1487,2,7,DANY,That wine merchant tried to poison me because of your information.
1488,2,7,JORAH,I stopped you from drinking his wine.
1489,2,7,DANY,Because you knew it was poisoned.
1490,2,7,JORAH,I suspected.
1491,2,7,DANY,You betrayed me from the first.
1492,2,7,JORAH,"Forgive me. I never meant...please, Khaleesi, forgive me."
1493,2,7,DANY,You sold my secrets to the man who killed my father and stole my brother's throne...
1494,2,7,JORAH,I have protected you. Fought for you. Killed for you.
1495,2,7,DANY,...and you want me to forgive you?
1496,2,7,JORAH,I have loved you.
1497,2,7,DANY,"Love? Love? How can you say that to me? Any other man, and I would have you executed. But you, I do not want you in my city dead or alive. Go back to your masters in King's Landing. Collect your pardon if you can."
1498,2,7,JORAH,"Daenerys, please."
1499,2,7,SCENE,[Ser Jorah goes for Dany's hand]
1500,2,7,DANY,"Don't ever presume to touch me again or speak my name. You have until dusk to collect your things and leave this city. If you're found in Meereen past break of day, I'll have your head thrown into Slaver's Bay. Go. Now."
1501,2,7,SCENE,[Ser Jorah rides away from Mereen]
1502,2,7,TO,MOAT CAILIN
1503,2,7,SCENE,[Ramsay is seen holding a flag out to Lord Bolton]
1504,2,7,RAMSAY,"Moat Cailin is yours, Father."
1505,2,7,BOLTON,Walk with me. Has there been any word from Locke?
1506,2,7,RAMSAY,No.
1507,2,7,RAMSAY,"Unimportant. A cripple, a young boy. None of the northern lords have seen them. Dead most likely. Most of the Ironborn have fled the North. Now more will follow, thanks to you. Tell me what you see."
1508,2,7,RAMSAY,"Moors, fields, hills."
1509,2,7,RAMSAY,Tell me what you see.
1510,2,7,RAMSAY,Nothing.
1511,2,7,ROOSE,"Not nothing. The North. Ride 700 miles that way, you're still in the North. 400 miles that way. 300 miles that way. The North is larger than the other six kingdoms combined. And I am the Warden of the North. The North is mine. Now tell me, what is your name?"
1512,2,7,RAMSAY,Ramsay Snow.
1513,2,7,ROOSE,"No, not Ramsay Snow. *hands Ramsay a scroll* Open it. From this day until your last day, you are Ramsay Bolton, son of Roose Bolton, Warden of the North."
1514,2,7,RAMSAY,"You honor me. I swear I will uphold your name and your tradition. I will be worthy of you, Father, I promise."
1515,2,7,SCENE,[The Bolton army rides forward on horseback]
1516,2,7,RAMSAY,"Come, Reek, I'll be needing a bath."
1517,2,7,TO,THE VALE
1518,2,7,SCENE,[Sansa is seen sitting on her bed sewing. Petyr knocks on her door]
1519,2,7,SANSA,Yes?
1520,2,7,PETYR,"First time I saw you, you were just a child. A girl from the North come to the capital for the first time. Not a child any longer. Why did you help me?"
1521,2,7,SANSA,They would have thrown you through the Moon Door if they found you guilty.
1522,2,7,PETYR,That's not an answer.
1523,2,7,SANSA,"If they'd have executed you, what would they have done with me?"
1524,2,7,PETYR,I don't know.
1525,2,7,SANSA,Neither do I.
1526,2,7,PETYR,Better to gamble on the man you know than the strangers you don't? And you think you know me?
1527,2,7,SANSA,I know what you want.
1528,2,7,PETYR,Do you?
1529,2,7,SCENE,[She looks up at him]
1530,2,7,TO,OUTSIDE THE VALE
1531,2,7,SCENE,[Arya and the Hound approach the Vale]
1532,2,7,HOUND,"I thought it'd make me happy, but it doesn't. Not really. Nothing makes you happy."
1533,2,7,ARYA,Lots of things make me happy.
1534,2,7,HOUND,Like what?
1535,2,7,ARYA,"Killing Polliver, killing Rorge."
1536,2,7,HOUND,So you're sad because you didn't get to kill Joffrey yourself. Is that it?
1537,2,7,ARYA,At least I could have been there to watch. I wanted to see the look in his eyes when he knew it was over.
1538,2,7,HOUND,"Aye, nothing in the world beats that look."
1539,2,7,ARYA,You protected him for most of his life. You think you could have saved him?
1540,2,7,HOUND,"I wasn't the damn wine taster. Little shit deserved to die, but poison...poison's a woman's weapon. Men kill with steel."
1541,2,7,ARYA,That's your stupid pride talking. It's why you'll never be a great killer. I'd have killed Joffrey with a chicken bone if I had to.
1542,2,7,HOUND,*laughs* I'd pay good money to see that. *grunts and rubs his neck*
1543,2,7,ARYA,You should have let me burn it.
1544,2,7,HOUND,It's a fleabite.
1545,2,7,ARYA,That fleabite's got you walking a lot slower than you used to.
1546,2,7,HOUND,"Well, we won't have to walk too much further."
1547,2,7,ARYA,You really think my aunt will pay for me?
1548,2,7,HOUND,"Aye, she'll pay."
1549,2,7,ARYA,I've never even met her.
1550,2,7,HOUND,"Doesn't matter. You're her blood. Family, honor, all that horseshit. It's all you lords and ladies ever talk about."
1551,2,7,ARYA,I'm not a lady.
1552,2,7,GUARD,Who would pass the Bloody Gate?
1553,2,7,HOUND,"The bloody Hound, Sandor Clegane. And his...traveling companion Arya Stark, niece of your lady Lysa Arryn."
1554,2,7,GUARD,Then I offer my condolences. Lady Arryn died. Three days ago.
1555,2,7,SCENE,[Arya bursts out laughing]
1556,2,7,TO,THE VALE
1557,2,7,SCENE,[Petyr is walking down the stairs with Robin]
1558,2,7,ROBIN,"I've never left home before, Uncle Petyr. I'm afraid to leave."
1559,2,7,PETYR,You shouldn't be.
1560,2,7,ROBIN,"The Lord of the Vale belongs in the Eyrie, Mother said. She said it's not safe outside."
1561,2,7,PETYR,It wasn't safe for her inside. People die at their dinner tables. They die in their beds. They die squatting over their chamber pots. Everybody dies sooner or later. Don't worry about your death. Worry about your life. Take charge of your life for as long as it lasts. That is what it means to be Lord of the Vale.
1562,2,7,SCENE,"[Sansa enters the scene and walks down the stairs, Petyr looks at her]"
1563,2,7,SANSA,Shall we go?
1564,2,7,TO,KING'S LANDING
1565,2,7,SCENE,"[In prison, Tyrion drinks wine from Jaime]"
1566,2,7,TYRION,Wine always helps. I thank you for it. Trial by combat. Deciding a man's guilt or innocence in the eyes of the gods by having two other men hack each other to pieces. Tells you something about the gods. How much longer?
1567,2,7,JAIME,Soon.
1568,2,7,TYRION,"Do you think Oberyn has a chance? The Red Viper of Dorne. You don't get a name like that unless you're deadly, right?"
1569,2,7,JAIME,I've never seen him fight.
1570,2,7,TYRION,"Oh, he's going to die. I'm going to die."
1571,2,7,JAIME,Oberyn believes in himself.
1572,2,7,TYRION,That's putting it mildly. What's the punishment for regicide? Drawing and quartering? Hanging? Breaking at the wheel?
1573,2,7,JAIME,Beheading.
1574,2,7,TYRION,"Seems rather ordinary. And he was my nephew as well, so what is that? Fratricide is brothers. Filicide is sons. Nepoticide. That's the one. Matricide, patricide, infanticide, suicide. There's no kind of killing that doesn't have its own word."
1575,2,7,JAIME,Cousins.
1576,2,7,TYRION,"Cousins, you're right. There is no word for cousin killing. Well done. Do you remember cousin Orson? Orson Lannister?"
1577,2,7,JAIME,Of course. Wet-nurse dropped him on his head. Left him simple.
1578,2,7,TYRION,Simple? Used to sit all day in the garden. Crushing beetles with a rock.
1579,2,7,TOGETHER,Khuu! Khuu! Khuu!
1580,2,7,TYRION,Nothing made him happier.
1581,2,7,JAIME,Nothing made you happier. You'd think being tormented from birth would have given you some affinity for the afflicted.
1582,2,7,TYRION,On the contrary. Laughing at another person's misery was the only thing that made me feel like everyone else.
1583,2,7,JAIME,"The joke wore thin, though."
1584,2,7,TYRION,For you. You drifted away.
1585,2,7,JAIME,I had other interests.
1586,2,7,TYRION,"Yes, other interests. But I stayed with Orson."
1587,2,7,JAIME,Why?
1588,2,7,TYRION,"I was curious. Why was he smashing all those beetles? What did he get out of it? First thing I did was ask him. ""Orson, why are you smashing all those beetles?"" He gave me an answer. ""Smash the beetles. Smash 'em. Khuu! Khuu! Khuu!"" I wasn't deterred. I was the smartest person I knew. Certainly I had the wherewithal to unravel the mysteries that lay at the heart of a moron. So I went to Maester Volarik's library."
1589,2,7,JAIME,"Volarik. Tried to touch me once. Turns out, far too much has been written about great men and not nearly enough about morons. Doesn't seem right. In any case, I found nothing that illuminated the nature of Orson's affliction or the reason behind his relentless beetle slaughter. So I went back to the source. I may not have been able to speak with Orson, but I could observe him, watch him the way men watch animals to come to a deeper understanding of their behavior. *picks up a beetle* And as I watched, I became more and more sure of it. There was something happening there. His face was like the page of a book written in a language I didn't understand. But he wasn't mindless. He had his reasons. And I became possessed with knowing what they were. I began to spend inordinate amounts of time watching him. I would eat my lunch in the garden, chewing my mutton to the music of ""khuu, khuu, khuu"". And when I wasn't watching him, I was thinking about him. Father droned on about the family legacy and I thought about Orson's beetles. I read the histories of Targaryen conquests. Did I hear dragon wings? No. I heard ""khuu, khuu, khuu"" and I still couldn't figure out why he was doing it. And I had to know, because it was horrible that all these beetles should be dying for no reason."
1590,2,7,JAIME,"Every day around the world, men, women, and children are murdered by the score. Who gives a dusty fuck about a bunch of beetles?"
1591,2,7,TYRION,"I know, I know. But still, it filled me with dread. Piles and piles of them, years and years of them. How many countless living crawling things smashed and dried out and returned to the dirt? In my dreams I found myself standing on a beach made of beetle husks stretching as far as the eye could see. I woke up crying, weeping for their shattered little bodies. I tried to stop Orson once."
1592,2,7,JAIME,He was twice your size.
1593,2,7,TYRION,"He just pushed me aside with a ""khuu"" and kept on smashing. Every day until that mule kicked him in the chest and killed him. *puts the beetle back on the ground* So what do you think? Why did he do it? What was it all about?"
1594,2,7,JAIME,I don't know.
1595,2,7,SCENE,[Bells begin chiming in the distance. Jaime goes to leave]
1596,2,7,JAIME,Good luck today.
1597,2,7,SCENE,"[Tyrion walks out toward the arena. The Lannisters are there, Oberyn is there getting ready for the battle. Tyrion passes him in handcuffs]"
1598,2,7,TYRION,Looks like very light armor.
1599,2,7,OBERYN,I like to move around.
1600,2,7,TYRION,You could at least wear a helmet. You shouldn't drink before a fight.
1601,2,7,OBERYN,You learn this during your years in the fighting pits? I always drink before a fight.
1602,2,7,TYRION,It could get you killed. It could get me killed.
1603,2,7,OBERYN,Today is not the day I die.
1604,2,7,ELLARIA,You're going to fight that?
1605,2,7,OBERYN,I'm going to kill that.
1606,2,7,ELLARIA,He is the biggest man I've ever seen.
1607,2,7,OBERYN,Size does not matter when you are flat on your back.
1608,2,7,TYRION,Thank the gods.
1609,2,7,PYCELL,"In the sight of gods and men, we gather to ascertain the guilt or innocence of this...man Tyrion Lannister. May the Mother grant them mercy. May the Father give them such justice as they deserve. And may the Warrior guide the hand of our champion..."
1610,2,7,SCENE,[Tywin speeds the process along in boredom. Horns sound to start the fight. Oberyn kisses Ellaria]
1611,2,7,ELLARIA,Don't leave me alone in this world.
1612,2,7,OBERYN,Never.
1613,2,7,SCENE,[Oberyn is tossed his weapon. He's very good with it. The crowd cheers]
1614,2,7,OBERYN,Have they told you who I am?
1615,2,7,MOUNTAIN,Some dead man.
1616,2,7,SCENE,[The Mountain lunges forward as the battle begins]
1617,2,7,OBERYN,I am the brother of Elia Martell. Do you know why I have come all the way to this stinking shit-pile of a city? For you.
1618,2,7,OBERYN,I'm going to hear you confess before you die. You raped my sister. You murdered her. You killed her children. Say it now and we can make this quick.
1619,2,7,OBERYN,Say it. You raped her. You murdered her. You killed her children.
1620,2,7,OBERYN,You raped her! You murdered her! You killed her children!
1621,2,7,SCENE,[Oberyn stabs the Mountain in the gut]
1622,2,7,OBERYN,You raped her! You murdered her!
1623,2,7,SCENE,[Oberyn charges at the Mountain to give him one final blow]
1624,2,7,OBERYN,You killed her children!
1625,2,7,SCENE,"[Everyone looks down, surprised. Oberyn pulls his weapon out of the Mountain and starts walking around his body]"
1626,2,7,OBERYN,"Wait. Are you dying? No, no, no. You can't die yet. You haven't confessed. Say it. Say her name. Elia Martell. You raped her. You killed her children. Elia Martell. Who gave you the order? Who gave you the order?! Say her name! You raped her! You murdered her! You killed her children. Say it. Say her name. Say it!"
1627,2,7,SCENE,"[The Mountain trips Oberyn and grabs him in his massive hands. He punches out his teeth and gets on top of Oberyn, squeezing his head]"
1628,2,7,MOUNTAIN,Elia Martell. I killed her children. Then I raped her. Then I smashed her head in like this!
1629,2,7,SCENE,[Ellaria screams in agony. Tyrion looks dead inside]
1630,2,8,DEFAULT,The Watchers on the Wall Lyrics Title: The Watchers on the Wall
1631,2,8,SCENE,[Opens on Jon Snow and Samwell Tarly standing on the edge of The Wall. It's night]
1632,2,8,SAM,What was she like?
1633,2,8,JON,She...she had red hair.
1634,2,8,SAM,Oh? How big were her feet?
1635,2,8,JON,Well what do you want me to say?
1636,2,8,SAM,I want you to tell me what it was like to have someone. To be with someone. To love someone and have them love you back. We're all gonna die a lot sooner than I'd planned. You're the closest I'll ever get to know it.
1637,2,8,JON,So you and Gilly never-
1638,2,8,SAM,No...she just had a baby! ...and she never offered.
1639,2,8,JON,"But if she had, you would've? You'd have broken your vows?"
1640,2,8,SAM,"The interesting thing is, our vows never specifically forbid intimate relations with women."
1641,2,8,JON,What?
1642,2,8,SAM,"""I shall take no wife"" yes, that's in there, there's no denying that. ""I shall father no children"" it's very specific. But what our vows have to say about other...activities...is open to interpretation."
1643,2,8,JON,I don't think Ser Alliser cares much for interpretation.
1644,2,8,SAM,"Anyway, there's nothing for him to interpret. We didn't. So what's it like?"
1645,2,8,JON,"It's...there's this person, this whole other person. And you're wrapped up in them and they're wrapped up in you and...you...for a little...for a little while you're more than just you, you're...well I don't know, I'm not a bleedin' poet!"
1646,2,8,SAM,"No, you're really not."
1647,2,8,JON,And what did I get for it? An arrow six inches from my heart.
1648,2,8,SAM,There'll be arrows for all of us soon I imagine.
1649,2,8,JON,There will.
1650,2,8,SAM,They've already done the worst thing to me they could ever do.
1651,2,8,JON,"Go get some sleep, Sam. I'll take this watch."
1652,2,8,SCENE,"[Sam gets in the lift back down off the wall. An owl perches on a post. Cut to the Wildlings where Thenn warg is standing with his eyes white. Ygritte, Tormund, and Styr are sitting in the background]"
1653,2,8,TORMUND,Did I ever tell you about her? My Sheila?
1654,2,8,YGRITTE,Yes.
1655,2,8,TORMUND,"Oh that was a night to remember. Of course, I'd had a good bit to drink *laughs* the fangs were sharp, but she knew how to use them. And she was nice and soft down below. No, she was no ordinary beast. Many's the man who--"
1656,2,8,YGRITTE,I know you never fucked a bear. You know you never fucked a bear. Right now I don't wanna think about the bear you never fucked. Right now all I want to think about is each one of these arrows finding its way into a Crow's heart.
1657,2,8,TORMUND,We could be waiting here a while.
1658,2,8,YGRITTE,"Good. The longer we wait, the more arrows I'll have. When they came up here, to our land, and put up a big wall and said it was their's. Then they started hunting us down. But this time, we're the one's doing the hunting."
1659,2,8,STYR,You've got a lot to say about killing. Even more words than arrows.
1660,2,8,YGRITTE,"Back in those villages I killed just as many of them as you did. More, I reckon."
1661,2,8,STYR,Yes. But none of those were your Crow lover.
1662,2,8,YGRITTE,I probably killed him already.
1663,2,8,STYR,So you've said.
1664,2,8,YGRITTE,And if not. The only thing left of him is gonna be his fun-bits hanging around me neck.
1665,2,8,STYR,And more words. Know what I think you do when you see him? Serve him up a nice juicy slice of ginger minge.
1666,2,8,SCENE,[Everyone laughs. Ygritte gets up and rushes towards Styr]
1667,2,8,YGRITTE,"What, you been thinkin' about that ginger minge? Wondering what it tastes like?"
1668,2,8,STYR,Maybe I have.
1669,2,8,YGRITTE,"Jon Snow is mine. *shouting* Anyone else tries to kill him, I'll have an arrow for them. *to Styr* And not one of your bald friends is fast enough to stop me."
1670,2,8,SCENE,"[Gilly walks along the top of the hill with her baby, looking down at the Wildling camp. She walks away quickly. Cut to Sam in the library reading]"
1671,2,8,AEMON,"And what is it that couldn't wait until morning, Tarly?"
1672,2,8,SAM,Maester Aemon. How did you know-
1673,2,8,AEMON,That it was you? Who else but Samwell Tarly would be wasting candles to read in the middle of the night?
1674,2,8,SAM,Let me help you.
1675,2,8,AEMON,"Oh, no need. I know my way around this library better than any other place in Castle Black. Thousands of books and no eyes to read them. Old age is a wonderful source of irony if nothing else. But you didn't answer my question, what are you reading?"
1676,2,8,SAM,Maester Faull
1677,2,8,AEMON,"Ah, the Wildlings. I can assure you that the closest Maester Faull ever got to a Wildling was this very library."
1678,2,8,SAM,But what he says about what they do...it's all true. It's exactly what the survivors of their raids report.
1679,2,8,AEMON,Yes. Imagine the stories Wildlings tell about us! Love is the death of duty. I told that to your friend Jon Snow once. He didn't listen and neither did you. That's why you abandoned your watch atop the wall to come here and read about the things that may have happened to the girl you love.
1680,2,8,SAM,I don't love her.
1681,2,8,AEMON,Yes you do.
1682,2,8,SAM,No.
1683,2,8,AEMON,Yes you do! I heard it in your voice when you first brought her to me. I remember how it sounds! I was in love once.
1684,2,8,SAM,You were?
1685,2,8,AEMON,"You can imagine all manner of horrors befalling that poor girl and her child, is it so difficult to imagine that an old person was once, more or less, like you?"
1686,2,8,SAM,"I'm sorry Maester, I didn't mean it like that."
1687,2,8,AEMON,You know who I was before I came here? What I could've been if I'd only said the word? Of course you do. I met many girls when I was Aemon Targaryen. A future king always does. Some of them were quite forward in their attempts to win my affections. One of them succeeded. I was very young.
1688,2,8,SAM,Who was she?
1689,2,8,AEMON,Ah ha. I could tell you everything about her. Who she was. How we met. The color of her eyes and the shape of her nose. I can see her right in front of me. She's more real than you are. We could spend all night trading tales of lost love. Nothing makes the past a sweeter place to visit than the prospect of imminent death. Go to bed Tarly.
1690,2,8,SCENE,[Aemon gets up and blows out the candle. Sam leaves the room and outside hears Gilly at the gate talking with Pypar]
1691,2,8,PYP,"I'm sorry, I can't open the gate for nobody. It's orders!"
1692,2,8,GILLY,"They killed everyone! Everyone but me and my baby. And they're out there. I saw them on the way here, they may have seen me, they may have followed me please!"
1693,2,8,PYP,"I'm sorry, I can't."
1694,2,8,GILLY,"If they find the boy, you don't know what they'll do."
1695,2,8,SAM,Pyp! Open the gate.
1696,2,8,PYP,I can't.
1697,2,8,GILLY,"Sam, is that you?!"
1698,2,8,SAM,Yes!
1699,2,8,PYP,Thorne gave me strict orders to not open the gate.
1700,2,8,SAM,"Oh, Pyp. Open the fucking gate!"
1701,2,8,SCENE,[Pyp goes to open the gate]
1702,2,8,PYP,I've never heard you curse before.
1703,2,8,SAM,"Yes, well, best get used to it."
1704,2,8,SCENE,[Gilly runs inside and Sam embraces her]
1705,2,8,SAM,"Are you alright? Shh, you're alright. Yeah, of course you are my brave little fella."
1706,2,8,GILLY,It was horrible.
1707,2,8,SAM,I'm so so sorry. I didn't know until I got back.
1708,2,8,GILLY,"Don't let them send me away, Sam."
1709,2,8,SAM,Never.
1710,2,8,GILLY,I know there's no women allowed.
1711,2,8,SAM,"Anyone who tries to throw you out will be having words with me. From now on, wherever you go, I go too."
1712,2,8,SCENE,[A horn sounds in the distance]
1713,2,8,ALLISER,Get ready!
1714,2,8,SCENE,[Members of the Night's Watch can be heard shouting frantically. The owl screeches. Cut to Thenn warg whose eyes turn back to normal]
1715,2,8,WARG,It's time.
1716,2,8,SCENE,[The Wildlings get up and look at the hill. The owl flies away as the Night's Watch prepare for battle. Jon Snow walks out to the edge of The Wall and looks down upon flames in the distance. The Night's Watch light torches preparing for battle. Barrels are rolled to the edge of The Wall]
1717,2,8,JANOS,Pick up the pace!
1718,2,8,SCENE,[The barrels are rolled into place]
1719,2,8,JON,"There we go, boys. That's one. There's two. Come on, let's get the next lot. That's the last of the oil, Ser Alliser."
1720,2,8,ALLISER,A hundred thousand you say?
1721,2,8,JON,Yes sir.
1722,2,8,ALLISER,You can say it if you like. We should've sealed the tunnel while we had the chance like you suggested.
1723,2,8,JON,"It was a difficult decision either way, Ser."
1724,2,8,ALLISER,"Do you know what leadership means, Lord Snow? It means that the person in charge gets second-guessed by every little twat with a mouth. But if he starts second-guessing himself, that's the end. For him. For the clever little twats. For everyone. This is not the end. Not for us. Not if you lot do your duty for however long it takes to beat them back. And then you get to go on hating me and I get to go on wishing your Wildling whore had finished the job."
1725,2,8,SCENE,[Sam and Gilly are walking down a hall. Sam unlocks a door and they both enter. The room is filled with supplies. Gilly lays her baby on a sack of something]
1726,2,8,SAM,You'll be safe down here. I'll check on you as soon as I can.
1727,2,8,GILLY,You're leaving me again?
1728,2,8,SAM,I'm not leaving you!
1729,2,8,GILLY,You're going up there and we're staying down here. That's leaving. You said from now on we'd stay together.
1730,2,8,SAM,I...I didn't mean in the same room.
1731,2,8,GILLY,What are you going to do out there?
1732,2,8,SAM,Help my brothers.
1733,2,8,GILLY,How?! You going to fight the Free Folk when they come? They'll kill you. In Molestown they killed everyone.
1734,2,8,SAM,I can't just hide here with you while they're fighting out there.
1735,2,8,GILLY,"Why not? You won't matter up there, you will down here."
1736,2,8,SAM,"Look. I am a man of the Night's Watch, Gilly. I made a promise to defend The Wall and I have to keep it, because that's what men do."
1737,2,8,SCENE,[Sam kisses Gilly]
1738,2,8,GILLY,Promise me you won't die.
1739,2,8,SAM,I promise you I won't die.
1740,2,8,SCENE,"[Sam turns around and leaves the room. Outside the Night's Watch is still getting ready for battle. Pyp sets some arrows up then stands back, scared]"
1741,2,8,SAM,There's a lot more Wildlings on the other side of the wall than this side. We've got us some weapons and things. This is the perfect place for us to be.
1742,2,8,PYP,I've never thrown a spear before. I've never held a sword with a proper edge. There's no place for me to be. You're not afraid?
1743,2,8,SAM,"Of course I'm afraid, there's a band of Wildlings coming to kill us."
1744,2,8,PYP,"Well if you're afraid of a band of Wildlings, how in seven hells did you manage to kill a White Walker?"
1745,2,8,SAM,"I didn't know I was going to kill it, but I had to do something I didn't have any choice, he was going to kill Gilly and take the baby. If someone had asked me my name right then, I wouldn't have known. I wasn't Samwell Tarly anymore. I wasn't a Steward in the Night's Watch or son of Randyll Tarly or any of that. I was nothing at all. And when you're nothing at all, there's no more reason to be afraid."
1746,2,8,PYP,But you're afraid now?
1747,2,8,SAM,"Yes, well, I'm not nothing anymore."
1748,2,8,SCENE,[Ygritte looks up at Castle Black. She sees Sam in the tower and she runs down the hill toward the other Wildlings]
1749,2,8,YGRITTE,Most of their men are up top. Didn't count more than twenty down there. Leftovers. They've got a little fat one and a little bony one manning the front.
1750,2,8,STYR,How high are the walls?
1751,2,8,YGRITTE,"Well, we'll be up and over before they know what's happened."
1752,2,8,TORMUND,Let's kill some Crows!

1755,2,8,SCENE,"[The Wildlings head towards Castle Black. Overhead shot pans to show the castle, The Wall, and then the flames in the distance. Mance Rayder's forces are seen stomping and yelling through the woods. A giant rides a giant mammoth. The Night's Watch perched upon the wall look down at them in awe]"
1756,2,8,ALLISER,"Archers knock, everyone else hold."
1757,2,8,SCENE,"[The archers get ready to shoot, Grenn accidentally drops a barrel]"
1758,2,8,ALLISER,I said knock and hold you cunts! Does knock mean draw?!
1759,2,8,WATCH,No Ser!
1760,2,8,ALLISER,Does fucking hold mean fucking drop?!
1761,2,8,WATCH,No Ser!
1762,2,8,ALLISER,You all plan to die here tonight?
1763,2,8,WATCH,No Ser!
1764,2,8,ALLISER,"That's very good to hear. Draw! MEMBER 1: Help, down below."
1765,2,8,SCENE,[Tormund and his men rush Castle Black as archers shoot at them. Ygritte grabs flaming arrows from the ground and shots up at the Night's Watch]

1768,2,8,JANOS,Now!

1770,2,8,JANOS,What?!
1771,2,8,ALLISER,"What are you fucking waiting for, loose!"
1772,2,8,JANOS,You heard the man . Loose!
1773,2,8,SCENE,"[The archers on The Wall let loose a barrage of arrows downward at Rayder's troops. They back up, then cheer. On the other side, Ygritte continues to let loose flaming arrows]"

1775,2,8,SCENE,[Pyp shoots a crossbow down at Tormund's troops]
1776,2,8,SAM,Did you get one?
1777,2,8,PYP,"No. Ah shit, Pyp. Shit. Sam."
1778,2,8,SAM,Yeah?
1779,2,8,PYP,I think we're gonna die.
1780,2,8,SAM,If you keep missing we will.
1781,2,8,SCENE,[Tormund's troops throw rope up at the gate. Alliser steps off the lift and walks towards the Night's Watch]
1782,2,8,ALLISER,Brothers! A hundred generations have defended this castle. We've never fallen before. She will not fall tongiht. Those are Things at our walls. They eat the flesh of the men they kill. Do you want to fill the belly of a Thing tonight?
1783,2,8,WATCH,No!
1784,2,8,ALLISER,"Tonight we fight. And when the sun rises I promise you, Castle Black will stand."
1785,2,8,SCENE,[Night's Watch cheers]
1786,2,8,ALLISER,The Night's Watch will stand.
1787,2,8,SCENE,[Night's Watch cheers]
1788,2,8,ALLISER,"With me now! Now, with me!"
1789,2,8,SCENE,[Alliser and the Night's Watch rush at the Wildlings that have scaled the gate. Pyp and Sam leave their position as Tormund scales the gate. On the other side Rayder's troops advance]
1790,2,8,JANOS,"No discipline. No training. Gang of thieves, that's all this is. I commanded the city watch of King's Landing. Those men obeyed orders."
1791,2,8,JON,We can't just let them attack the gate!
1792,2,8,JANOS,"The bars of those gates are four inches of cold, rolled steel."
1793,2,8,JON,"Those are giants riding mammoths down there. Do you think your cold, rolled steel's gonna stop them?"
1794,2,8,JANOS,No such thing as giants. They're stories for the children.

1806,2,8,SCENE,"[A Wildling tries to shoot an arrow up at The Wall unsuccessfully. A giant stands next to him and shoots his own arrow up. The first rips through one of the posts. The second clears one of the Night's Watch straight off the wall. At Castle Black the fighting continues. Styr kills a man, the blood splatters on Olly's face. Janos comes down off the lift and Olly returns the lift to the top. Wildlings break into the kitchen. Janos cowardly runs down a hall toward where Gilly and her baby are hiding. He looks at her in shock. Outside Pyp finally hits someone with his crossbow.]"

1835,2,8,SAM,"And find a weapon, Olly. Fight them!"
1836,2,8,SCENE,"[Olly looks down at a bow and arrow. On The Wall, barrels of flaming oil are dropped down on the giants and the mammoth. The mammoth goes running off and one of the giants chases after it. Up top, one of the barrels got stuck and the men of the Night's Watch frantically try to get it off the ramp. A spear is fired down at one of the giants and it hits him right in the back. The other giant shouts in anger and goes to raise the gate with his bare hands. The barrel explodes on the ramp. Sam approaches Jon]"
1837,2,8,JON,What are you doing up here?
1838,2,8,SAM,The Wildlings are over the walls. Ser Alliser has fallen. The castle walls can't stand much longer.
1839,2,8,JON,"Ed. You have The Wall. If they try the mammoths again, drop fire on them. If the climbers get too high, drop the scythe on them."

1848,2,8,GRENN,We hold the gate!
1849,2,8,SCENE,[The giant lifts the gate and goes under it]
1850,2,8,DONNEL,Mother save me. Father save me.
1851,2,8,GRENN,"The gods aren't down here. It's the six of us, you hear me?"
1852,2,8,DONNEL,"No, please."
1853,2,8,SCENE,"[The giant rushes toward the inner gate as Grenn and his men stand in fear, ready to fight]"
1854,2,8,GRENN,"Night gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. I shall wear no crowns"
1855,2,8,TOGETHER,"And win no glory. I shall live and die at my post. I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the walls. I am the shield that guards the realms of men. I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all the nights to come!"
1856,2,8,SCENE,"[Jon, Sam, and the other men ride the lift to the bottom]"
1857,2,8,JON,*to Sam* I don't want you out there.

1860,2,8,JON,I need him more than I need you.
1861,2,8,SCENE,"[Sam nods as Jon opens the lift door early and leaps out and begins fighting. So begins the most incredible shot in the series, as the camera pans around the entire battlefield showing us glimpses of this truly epic battle. Sam runs to a door and unlocks it]"

1863,2,8,SCENE,"[Ghost runs out and attacks one of the men that Jon was fighting. Tormund gets his first arrow to the back. Styr sees Jon and rushes to fight him. They go at it for a bit. Ygritte runs out of arrows so she jumps down and steals some from a dead body. Styr and Jon are still fighting as Ygritte finally spots Jon. Styr slams Jon's face against an anvil. Jon kills Styr with a hammer. As he turns around he sees Yrgitte with an arrow aimed right at him. They both stare, Jon smiles. An arrow goes straight through Ygritte's chest. She falls to the ground. It was Olly, that bastard. Jon rushes to catch Ygritte]"

1867,2,8,SCENE,[Jon nods]
1868,2,8,YGRITTE,We should've stayed in that cave.

1880,2,8,JON,"Tormund. It's over, let it end."

1882,2,8,SCENE,[Jon grabs a crossbow and shoots Tormund in the leg then kicks away his weapon]
1883,2,8,JON,Put him in chains. We'll question him later.
1884,2,8,TORMUND,I should've thrown you from the top of your wall boy!
1885,2,8,JON,"Aye, you should've."
1886,2,8,SCENE,[Gilly hears someone entering her room. She grabs a leg of meat as a weapon and rushes the door]

1889,2,8,SAM,We held them off.
1890,2,8,JON,For one night.
1891,2,8,SAM,This is a great victory.
1892,2,8,JON,"Great victory? Mance was testing our defenses. He almost made it through. And he has more giants, he has more mammoths. He has a thousand times as many men. They'll hit us again tonight. Maybe we can hold them off for a day or two, but we can never beat them."
1893,2,8,SAM,Where are you going?
1894,2,8,JON,I'm going to find Mance.
1895,2,8,SAM,To...you can't do that. No one gave you any orders.
1896,2,8,JON,"Who's left to give orders? The Wildling army is only an army because of Mance. He united a hundred warring tribes. Without Mance they lose their leader. They lose their purpose, they go back to fighting each other, scatter back to their home."
1897,2,8,SAM,Without Mance? You're going to kill him?
1898,2,8,JON,I'm going to try.
1899,2,8,SAM,"They'll never let you within a hundred yards of him. And if you did, even if you managed to kill him."
1900,2,8,JON,He'll kill me. If I don't go he'll kill me anyway. They'll kill the rest of us too.
1901,2,8,SAM,He won't just kill ya. They'll boil you. They'll filet you. They'll make it last days!
1902,2,8,JON,You're right. It's a bad plan. What's your plan?
1903,2,8,SCENE,"[Jon stands there for a second as he and Sam look at each other, then he walks off, Sam scampering after him. They walk down the tunnel toward the gate. The giant and Grenn and his men are dead on the ground]"
1904,2,8,JON,"They held the gate. Get some brothers down here to help you. You need to burn the bodies. Raise the outer gate, then lower it again as soon as I'm out."
1905,2,8,SCENE,[Sam waves his torch to signal the raising of the gate. Jon removes his sword]
1906,2,8,SAM,What are you doing?
1907,2,8,JON,I promised Jeor I'd never lose it again. *he hands the sword to Sam* In case I don't come back.
1908,2,8,SAM,Jon. Come back.

1913,2,9,SCENE,[Mance and Jon enter Mance's tent and take a seat]
1914,2,9,MANCE,"It appears my trusting nature got the better of me. It's happened before. I was hoping your loyalty was real when you pledged yourself to us, Jon Snow, truly I was."
1915,2,9,JON,"The Halfhand ordered me to join your army and bring back whatever information I could to Castle Black. He made me kill him so you'd trust me. I was loyal, to him and to my Night's Watch vows ."
1916,2,9,MANCE,"All of your vows? She wasn't enough to turn ya, eh? Were you enough to turn her?"
1917,2,9,JON,She put three arrows in me when I escaped.
1918,2,9,MANCE,Did you see her again at Castle Black?
1919,2,9,JON,Yes.
1920,2,9,MANCE,And?
1921,2,9,JON,She's dead.
1922,2,9,MANCE,Your doing?
1923,2,9,JON,No.
1924,2,9,MANCE,We'll drink to her.
1925,2,9,SCENE,[One of the Wildlings gets two cups and fills them with liquid. Jon looks at Mance]
1926,2,9,MANCE,"Of all the ways I'd kill you, poison would be the last."
1927,2,9,SCENE,[They pick up their cups]
1928,2,9,MANCE,Ygritte.
1929,2,9,JON,Ygritte.
1930,2,9,SCENE,[They take a sip and Jon begins to cough]
1931,2,9,JON,That's not wine.
1932,2,9,MANCE,"No, it's a proper Northern drink , Jon Snow. You did well. Fought hard. Killed some of our strongest men. One of our giants went into your tunnel and never came out again. Mag the Mighty."
1933,2,9,JON,He's dead. He killed my friend Grenn.
1934,2,9,MANCE,He was their king. Last of a bloodline that stretches back before the First Men.
1935,2,9,JON,Grenn came from a farm.
1936,2,9,SCENE,[They lift their cups]

1938,2,9,JON,Grenn and Mag.
1939,2,9,MANCE,"Kullback, could I trouble you for something to eat? I don't imagine our guest has eaten anything in quite some time. So. You're here to strike a bargain?"
1940,2,9,JON,Turn your army around and go home.
1941,2,9,MANCE,You know I know you're low on arrows. You're low on oil. You're low on men. How many are left? 50?
1942,2,9,JON,I told Tormund and Orell. We have more than a thousand men.
1943,2,9,MANCE,"I showed you everything I had. The whole army, a hundred thousand strong, and what did you do? You fired on us with everything you had. It wasn't much. Soon as I saw that I sent four hundred men to climb the wall. An unmanned stretch five miles west of here. A lot of them will die climbing, but most of them will be over by the end of the day. This is me being honest with you, Jon Snow, which is more than you've ever done for me. My people have bled enough. We're not here to conquer, we're here to hide behind your wall just like you. We need your tunnel. Now we both know that winter is coming and if my people aren't south of the wall when it comes in earnest, we'll all end up worse than dead. Wanna strike a bargain with me? Here's a bargain. You go back, you open the gates to us and I swear to you that no one else will die. Refuse and we'll kill every last man in Castle Black."
1944,2,9,SCENE,[Jon looks over towards the knife. The Wildlings get their weapons ready]
1945,2,9,MANCE,"Ah! Oh, that's why you're here. I reckon you could do it before any of them could stop ya. They'd kill you of course, they'd kill ya slow, but ya knew that when you came in here. Are you capable of that, Jon Snow? Killing a man in his own tent when he's just offered ya peace? Is that what the Night's Watch is? Is that what you are?"
1946,2,9,SCENE,"[A horn blows in the distance. Everyone scrambles, Mance draws a knife to Jon's neck]"
1947,2,9,MANCE,You attacking us?
1948,2,9,JON,"No, it's like you said, we don't have the men."

1955,2,9,SCENE,[Mance nods]
1956,2,9,STANNIS,You know who I am?
1957,2,9,MANCE,Never had the pleasure.
1958,2,9,DAVOS,"This is Stannis Baratheon, the one true king of the seven kingdoms."
1959,2,9,MANCE,We're not in the seven kingdoms and you're not dressed for this weather.
1960,2,9,STANNIS,It is customary to kneel when surrendering to a king.
1961,2,9,MANCE,We do not kneel.
1962,2,9,STANNIS,"I'll have thousands of your men in chains by nightfall, I'll have nowhere to put them and nothing to feed them. I'm not here to slaughter beat dogs. Their fate depends on their king."
1963,2,9,MANCE,"All the same, we do not kneel."
1964,2,9,STANNIS,Take these men away.
1965,2,9,DAVOS,What are men of the Night's Watch doing in a Wildling camp?
1966,2,9,JON,I was sent to discuss terms with the king beyond the wall.
1967,2,9,DAVOS,You're speaking to the one true king boy. You'll address him as your grace.
1968,2,9,JON,"I know he's the king. My father died for him. My name is Jon Snow, your grace. I'm Ned Stark's son."
1969,2,9,STANNIS,Your father was an honorable man.
1970,2,9,JON,"He was, your grace."
1971,2,9,STANNIS,What do you think he'd have done with him?
1972,2,9,JON,"I was this man's prisoner once. He could've tortured me, he could've killed me, but he spared my life. I think my father would've taken him prisoner, listened to what he had to say."
1973,2,9,STANNIS,Very well. *to Davos* Take him.
1974,2,9,JON,"Your grace. If my father'd seen the things that I've seen, he'd also tell you to burn the dead before nightfall. All of them."

1976,2,9,SCENE,[ Qyburn is seen closely analyzing Gregor's body. He's in Pycelle's lab with Cersei ]
1977,2,9,PYCELLE,I would suggest milk of the poppy to ease his pain but he is completely insensate.
1978,2,9,CERSEI,Bloody Martells .
1979,2,9,PYCELLE,The cause appears to be manticore venom.
1980,2,9,QYBURN,"It is, yes, manticore."
1981,2,9,PYCELLE,"I've read a good deal about it. It's a horrible poison, usually Mantari in origin. Oh! Yes, yes. There's nothing to be done."
1982,2,9,QYBURN,Yes there is.
1983,2,9,PYCELLE,May I ask what you think you're doing?
1984,2,9,QYBURN,Saving him.
1985,2,9,PYCELLE,"Your grace. I wish it were otherwise, but Ser Gregor is beyond saving. Well, well beyond. This man is not even a Maester, let alone Grand Maester."
1986,2,9,QYBURN,That's for the best. No Maester knows how to save him.
1987,2,9,PYCELLE,"That is exactly the sort of arrogance that had him expelled from the citadel, your grace. His curiosity was deemed dangerous and unnatural. Rightly so in my opinion."
1988,2,9,CERSEI,"You're dismissed, Grand Maester."
1989,2,9,PYCELLE,Your grace. This is my laboratory!
1990,2,9,CERSEI,Not anymore.
1991,2,9,SCENE,[Pycelle leaves the laboratory angrily as Qyburn tries to save Gregor's body]
1992,2,9,CERSEI,You can save him?
1993,2,9,QYBURN,"Difficult to say, your grace, but if my past work is any guide. We stand a chance."
1994,2,9,CERSEI,Do everything you can. Come to me with anything you need.
1995,2,9,QYBURN,"Thank you, your grace. You should know, the process may change him, somewhat."
1996,2,9,CERSEI,Will it weaken him?
1997,2,9,QYBURN,Oh no.
1998,2,9,CERSEI,Very well then.
1999,2,9,SCENE,[Cersei leaves as Qyburn drains Gregor's blood. Cersei is seen arguing with Tywin]
2000,2,9,TYWIN,"Not another word. We've been over this, the matter's closed."
2001,2,9,CERSEI,I'm opening it again.
2002,2,9,TYWIN,You are betrothed to Loras Tyrell. Still betrothed to Loras Tyrell and you will marry Loras Tyrell as soon as Tommen marries Margaery.
2003,2,9,CERSEI,I will not.
2004,2,9,TYWIN,"Jaime cannot marry or inherit lands. Tyrion's sentence will be carried out tomorrow. You have, on several occasions, made great claims about your commitment to this family's future. Your role in that future is more vital now than it ever was."
2005,2,9,CERSEI,"I don't care. I will stay in King's Landing where I belong with my son, the king."
2006,2,9,TYWIN,"When you were nine years old, I was called to the capital. I decided to take your brother with me and not you. You insisted that you would not be left at Casterly Rock under any circumstances and if you recall-"
2007,2,9,CERSEI,I'm not interested in hearing another one of your smug stories about the time you won. This isn't going to be one of those times.
2008,2,9,TYWIN,Do you think you'll be the first person dragged into a sept to be married against her will?
2009,2,9,CERSEI,"When you marched into the throne room to tell me we'd won the Battle at Blackwater, do you remember?! I was sitting on the iron throne with Tommen. I was about to give him essence of nightshade, that's how far I was willing to go when I thought someone awful had come to take my son away. Someone awful is coming to take him away."
2010,2,9,TYWIN,No.
2011,2,9,CERSEI,"Joffrey is dead. Myrcella's been sold like livestock . And now you want to ship me off to Highgarden and steal my boy, my last boy. Margaery will dig her claws in and you will dig your claws in and you will fight over him like beasts until you rip him apart. I will burn our house to the ground before I let that happen."
2012,2,9,TYWIN,And how will you do that?
2013,2,9,CERSEI,I'll tell everyone the truth.
2014,2,9,TYWIN,And what truth would that be?
2015,2,9,CERSEI,"You don't know, do you? You never believed it. How is that possible? What am I saying, of course it's possible. How can someone so consumed by the idea of his family have any conception what his actual family was doing? We were right there in front of you and you didn't see us. One look in the past twenty years, one real look and you would've known."
2016,2,9,TYWIN,Known what?
2017,2,9,CERSEI,Everything they say is true about Jaime and me.
2018,2,9,TYWIN,"No, no, no, no, no."
2019,2,9,CERSEI,Your legacy is a lie.
2020,2,9,TYWIN,I don't believe you.
2021,2,9,CERSEI,Yes you do.
2022,2,9,SCENE,"[Cersei walks away, leaving Tywin standing there alone. Jaime is turning pages in a book in another room]"
2023,2,9,CERSEI,Jaime.
2024,2,9,JAIME,"You won. One fewer brother. Must be proud of yourself. There's really nothing you wouldn't do, is there?"
2025,2,9,CERSEI,"For my family, no. I would do things for my family you couldn't imagine."
2026,2,9,JAIME,Tyrion is your family.
2027,2,9,CERSEI,He's not.
2028,2,9,JAIME,You don't get to choose.
2029,2,9,CERSEI,"I do, so do you. You can choose the creature that killed our mother to come into this world-"
2030,2,9,JAIME,Are you really mad enough to blame him for that? He didn't decide to kill her. He was an infant.
2031,2,9,CERSEI,"A disease doesn't decide to kill you, all the same you cut it out before it does. What do you decide? What do you choose?"
2032,2,9,JAIME,"The things I did to get back to you, to endure all that, only to find you-"
2033,2,9,SCENE,[Cersei kisses Jaime]
2034,2,9,CERSEI,I choose you.

2039,2,9,JAIME,You told him?
2040,2,9,CERSEI,"I told him I wouldn't marry Loras Tyrell. I told him I'm staying right here with Tommen, with you."
2041,2,9,JAIME,You think he'll just accept that?
2042,2,9,CERSEI,Go and ask him.
2043,2,9,SCENE,[Cersei kisses Jaime]
2044,2,9,JAIME,What did you say?
2045,2,9,CERSEI,"I don't want to talk about Tywin Lannister. I don't choose Tywin Lannister, I don't love Tywin Lannister. I love my brother. I love my lover. People will whisper, they'll make their jokes. Let them. They're all so small I can't even see them. I only see what matters."

2053,2,9,FENNESZ,"*in Valyrian* Thank you for seeing me, your grace. My name is Fennesz. I can speak the common tongue if you wish."
2054,2,9,DAENERYS,You speak it very well.
2055,2,9,FENNESZ,"Before you freed me, I belonged to Master Mighdal. I was tutor to his children. I taught them languages and history. They know a great deal about your family because of me. Little Calla is only seven, but she admires you very much."
2056,2,9,DAENERYS,I hope I can prove worthy of her admiration. What can I do for you?
2057,2,9,FENNESZ,"When you took the city, the children begged me not to leave the house. But Master Mighdal and I agreed that I must. So I lost my home. Now I live on the streets."
2058,2,9,DAENERYS,I have outfitted mess halls to feed all former slaves and barracks to shelter them.
2059,2,9,FENNESZ,"I do not mean to offend, your grace. I went to one of these places. The young prey on the old. Take what they want and beat us if we resist."
2060,2,9,DAENERYS,"My Unsullied will make them safe again in short order my friend, this I promise you."
2061,2,9,FENNESZ,"Even if they are safe, who would I be there? What purpose would I serve? With my master, I was a teacher. I had the respect and love of these children."
2062,2,9,DAENERYS,What is it that you want from me?
2063,2,9,FENNESZ,"Your grace, I ask you to let me sell myself back to Master Mighdal."
2064,2,9,DAENERYS,"You want to return to a man who owned you, like a goat or a chair?"
2065,2,9,FENNESZ,"Please, your grace, the young may rejoice in the new world you've built for them. But for those of us too old to change there is only fear and squalor. I am not alone. There are many outside waiting to beg the same-"
2066,2,9,DAENERYS,I did not take this city to preside over the injustice I fought to destroy. I took it to bring people freedom. But freedom means making your own choices. I will allow you to sign a contract with your former master. It may not cover a period lasting longer than a year.
2067,2,9,FENNESZ,"Thank you, your grace. Thank you."
2068,2,9,SCENE,[Fennesz leaves slowly]
2069,2,9,BARRISTAN,The masters will take advantage of this situation. The men serving them will be slaves in all but name.

2079,2,9,DAENERYS,What was her name?
2080,2,9,MISSANDEI,"Zala, your grace."
2081,2,9,DAENERYS,How old was she?
2082,2,9,MISSANDEI,Three.
2083,2,9,DAENERYS,Three. *in Valyrian* And still no word on Drogon?
2084,2,9,WORM,"*in Valyrian* Sailors saw him flying over the Black Cliffs three days ago, my queen. Nothing since then."
2085,2,9,DAENERYS,*in Valyrian* Meet me in the catacombs.
2086,2,9,SCENE,[ The entrance to the catacombs is rolled open. Daenerys' dragons enter followed by Daenerys. Inside there is food for them.

2095,2,9,TORMUND,You want me alive so you can torture me?
2096,2,9,JON,No one's going to torture you.
2097,2,9,TORMUND,So how do we die? Hanging? Beheading? Drop us from the top of the wall?
2098,2,9,JON,I don't know what happens to the prisoners.
2099,2,9,TORMUND,Who decides?
2100,2,9,JON,I suppose Stannis does.
2101,2,9,TORMUND,He your king now?
2102,2,9,JON,I don't have a king.
2103,2,9,TORMUND,"You spent too much time with us, Jon Snow. You can never be a kneeler again."
2104,2,9,JON,We're gonna burn the bodies of your dead. Do you want to say any words over them?
2105,2,9,TORMUND,Words? What kind of words?
2106,2,9,JON,Funeral words. I don't know how the Free Folk do it.
2107,2,9,TORMUND,Do what?

2111,2,9,TORMUND,Snow. Did you love her? She loved you.
2112,2,9,JON,She told you?

2153,2,9,BRIENNE,What sort of hobble?
2154,2,9,PODRICK,"A figure-eight, like you taught me."
2155,2,9,BRIENNE,If you did it like I taught you then the horses would be here.

2175,2,9,ARYA,Mine never wanted to. Said fighting was for boys.

2190,2,9,HOUND,You’re paid by the Lannisters. You’re here for the bounty on me.

2203,2,9,HOUND,"Safety?! Where the fuck’s that? Her aunt in the Eyrie’s dead. Her mother’s dead, her father’s dead, her brother’s dead. Winterfell’s a pile of rubble. There’s no safety, you dumb bitch. If you don’t know that by now, you’re the wrong one to watch over her."
2204,2,9,BRIENNE,And that’s what you’re doing? Watching over her?
2205,2,9,HOUND,"Aye, that’s what I’m doing."
2206,2,9,SCENE,[They begin a swordfight. The Hound seems to have the upper hand but Brienne defends well and floors him.]

2223,2,9,HOUND,"Unless there’s a Maester hiding behind that rock, aye, I’m done. I’d skin you alive for wine. [Arya offers water.] Fuck water! Killed by a woman. I bet you liked that. Go on, go after her. She’ll help you. Going out alone, you won’t last a day out there"
2224,2,9,ARYA,I’ll last longer than you.
2225,2,9,HOUND,"You remember where the heart is? Fuck it. I’m ready. Go on, girl. Another name off your list. You kept promising me. I cut down your butcher’s boy, the ginger. He was begging for mercy. Please sir, please don’t kill me, please, please. Bled all over my horse. Saddle stunk of butcher’s boy for weeks. And your sister, your pretty sister.

2250,2,9,TYWIN,"Tyrion! Put down the crossbow. Who released you? Ah, your brother ,I expect. He always had a soft spot for you. Come, we’ll go and talk in my chambers. Is this how you want to speak to me? Shaming your father has always given you pleasure…"
2251,2,9,TYRION,"All my life, you’ve wanted me dead."
2252,2,9,TYWIN,"Yes. But you refused to die. I respect that, even admire it. You fight for what’s yours. I’d never let them execute you; is that what you fear? I’d never let Illyn Payne take your head. You’re a Lannister. You’re my son."
2253,2,9,TYRION,I loved her.
2254,2,9,TYWIN,Who?
2255,2,9,TYRION,Shae.

2259,2,9,TYRION,It doesn’t matter?
2260,2,9,TYWIN,She was a whore!
2261,2,9,TYRION,Say that word again.
2262,2,9,TYWIN,And what? You’ll kill your own father in the privy? No. You’re my son. Enough of this nonsense…
2263,2,9,TYRION,"I am your son, and you sentenced me to die. You knew I didn’t poison Joffrey, but you sentenced me all the same. Why?"
2264,2,9,TYWIN,Enough. We’ll go back to my chambers and speak with some dignity.
2265,2,9,TYRION,I can’t go back there. She’s in there.
2266,2,9,TYWIN,"What, are you afraid of a dead whore?"
2267,2,9,SCENE,[Tyrion fires the crossbow at Tywin.]
2268,2,9,TYWIN,You shot me. You’re no son of mine.

2305,3,0,MAGGY,Listen to your friend.
2306,3,0,CERSEI,They said that you were terrifying. With cat’s teeth and three eyes. You’re not terrifying. You’re boring.
2307,3,0,MAGGY,You don’t know what I am.
2308,3,0,CERSEI,I know you’re a witch and you can see the future. Tell me mine.
2309,3,0,MAGGY,Everybody wants to know their future. Until they know their future.
2310,3,0,CERSEI,This is my father’s land. My land. Tell me my future or I’ll have your two boring eyes gouged out of your head. Maggy chuckles then hands Cersei a knife.
2311,3,0,MAGGY,Your blood. Give me a taste. Cersei cuts her thumb then Maggy grabs her hand to suck her blood.
2312,3,0,MAGGY,Three questions you get. You won’t like the answers.
2313,3,0,CERSEI,I’ve been promised to the prince. When will we marry?
2314,3,0,MAGGY,You’ll never wed the prince. You’ll wed the king.
2315,3,0,CERSEI,But I will be queen?
2316,3,0,MAGGY,"Oh yes, you’ll be queen. For a time. In comes another. Younger, more beautiful, to cast you down and take all you hold dear."
2317,3,0,CERSEI,Will the king and I have children?
2318,3,0,MAGGY,"No. The king will have 20 children, and you will have 3."
2319,3,0,CERSEI,That doesn’t make sense.
2320,3,0,MAGGY,Gold will be their crowns. Gold their shrouds. Maggy starts laughing. Cersei’s thumb starts dripping blood.
2321,3,0,MELARA,"Come on, we have to go. We have to go! Cersei!"
2322,3,0,TO,CERSEI’S FACE - KING’S LANDING - MODERN DAY Cersei gets out of a cart to a funeral procession outside of the Great Sept of Baelor. She walks to the top of the stairs.
2323,3,0,PRIEST,"Your grace, we are honored by your presence. The mourners are waiting."
2324,3,0,CERSEI,They will keep waiting. I want a moment alone with him.
2325,3,0,PRIEST,"But your grace, many of these lords and ladies have travelled day and night to be here… Cersei starts walking away."
2326,3,0,PRIEST,From all seven kingdoms…
2327,3,0,CERSEI,They will wait. INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR Tywin’s body rests with hand-painted stones on top of his eyes. Jaime presides over the body. Cersei walks next to him.
2328,3,0,CERSEI,"He never wanted you to be a King’s Guard, but here you are, protecting his dead body."
2329,3,0,JAIME,"What he built. The towers. He built it for us. He meant it for us. They’re going to try to take it away, all of it."
2330,3,0,CERSEI,They?
2331,3,0,JAIME,All of them out there are enemies. They’re waiting a night to make sure he’s really dead and as soon as they see the stones on his eyes they’ll set to work on tearing us apart.
2332,3,0,CERSEI,"They had nothing to do with it. The man who murdered our father, he tore us apart, he’s the enemy. I’ve been telling you for years, you’ve been defending him for years…"
2333,3,0,JAIME,This is exactly what they want.
2334,3,0,CERSEI,...and now our father is dead. And that little monster is out there somewhere drawing breath. Did you set him free? No response from Jaime.
2335,3,0,CERSEI,"Tyrion may be a monster but at least he killed our father on purpose. You killed him by mistake. With stupidity. You’re a man of action, aren’t you? When it occurs to you to do something you do it, nevermind the consequences. Take a look. (gestures towards Tywin) Look at the consequences. Here they are. He loved you more than anyone in this world. Cersei kisses Tywin on the head then leaves. INT. CRATE - PENTOS We see men working with rope, merchants carrying boxes, and trees through a hole in the crate. The crate is set down and opened up. Tyrion comes out with Varys standing over him."
2336,3,0,VARYS,Apologies.
2337,3,0,TYRION,I still don’t see why I had to stay in this fucking crate once we set sail.
2338,3,0,VARYS,"I saved your life. If they catch you, they catch me. I cannot say I feel overly guilty about leaving you in that “fucking crate”."
2339,3,0,TYRION,Do you know what it’s like to stuff your shit through one of those air holes?
2340,3,0,VARYS,No. I only know what it’s like to pick up your shit and throw it overboard. Tyrion looks around.
2341,3,0,TYRION,Pentos? Varys nods.
2342,3,0,VARYS,"The home of my colleague. Ilyrio Mopatis. A merchant. He and I met many years ago, through mutual friends. A group of people who saw Robert Baratheon for the disaster he was. We tried to do what was best for the realm by supporting the Targaryen restoration. And thus began the chain of mistakes that has led us both here. Things have gotten worse, not better. Westeros needs to be saved from itself. Tyrion pours himself a cup of wine and drinks it."
2343,3,0,TYRION,Much better.
2344,3,0,VARYS,My lord?
2345,3,0,TYRION,I don’t think I am anymore. A lord. Are you a lord if you kill your father? I don’t suppose they revoke your nobility for killing a whore. That has to be happen all the time.
2346,3,0,VARYS,You already drank yourself across the Narrow Sea.
2347,3,0,TYRION,In a box. Why stop now?
2348,3,0,VARYS,Because we are talking about the future of our country. Tyrion finishes his wine.
2349,3,0,TYRION,The future is shit. Just like the past. He pukes up his wine and then pours himself another cup.
2350,3,0,TO,"MEEREEN The giant bronze Harpy statue is pulled down from the top of the pyramid. EXT. BROTHEL - MEEREEN An Unsullied soldier, White Rat, walks up to a prostitute and hands her a coin. She takes him into her room and starts undressing him."
2351,3,0,PROSTITUTE,You want the same? Same as always? She undresses herself
2352,3,0,RAT,You… you don’t have to.
2353,3,0,PROSTITUTE,"Habit. She puts her clothes back on and lays down next to him in bed, stroking his head and humming. A knife slits his throat. White Rat looks up and sees a member of the Sons of the Harpy holding the knife INT. GREAT PYRAMID - MEEREEN A golden Sons of the Harpy mask rests on the table."
2354,3,0,DAENERYS,Sons of the Harpy?
2355,3,0,BARRISTAN,"Yes, your grace. They left it on the body."
2356,3,0,DAENERYS,They’ve never killed before.
2357,3,0,BARRISTAN,"It was only a matter of time, your grace. Conquerors are always met with resistance."
2358,3,0,DAENERYS,I didn’t conquer them. Their own people did.
2359,3,0,MOSSADOR,"They do not see us as people, Your Grace."
2360,3,0,DAENERYS,"Then they will have to learn to see things differently, Mossador. He did not risk his life fighting for freedom so cowards in masks could take it away. And I did not take up residence in this pyramid so I could watch the city below decline into chaos. What was the name of the man you lost?"
2361,3,0,WORM,"White Rat, your grace."
2362,3,0,DAENERYS,I want him buried with honor. Publicly. In the Temple of the Graces.
2363,3,0,BARRISTAN,The Sons of the Harpy will hear that message.
2364,3,0,MOSSADOR,Make them very angry.
2365,3,0,DAENERYS,Angry snakes lash out. Makes chopping off their heads that much easier. Find the men who did this and bring them to me. INT. HALLWAY The Unsullied are putting their armor on. Missandei walks up to Grey Worm.
2366,3,0,MISSANDEI,Torgo Nudho.
2367,3,0,WORM,Missandei hin Naath.
2368,3,0,MISSANDEI,I wanted to speak with you. The other Unsullied leave the room.
2369,3,0,WORM,Why do you come?
2370,3,0,MISSANDEI,"White Rat, the Unsullied who… I have heard they found his body in a brothel. I have heard that more than one Unsullied has been known to visit Meereen’s brothels. May I ask you why? Why would an Unsullied go to a brothel?"
2371,3,0,WORM,I do not know. I must go.
2372,3,0,TO,CASTLE BLACK Jon Snow is parrying with Olly. Jon puts his sword to Olly’s neck.
2373,3,0,JON,Get your shield up.
2374,3,0,OLLY,It’s too heavy.
2375,3,0,JON,"If it wasn’t heavy it wouldn’t stop a sword, now get it up. Jon knocks Olly into the ground then helps him up."
2376,3,0,JON,Come. Try it again. Drive at me. Keep your shield up. Or I’ll ring your head like a bell. Sam and Gilly are watching them parry from afar.
2377,3,0,GILLY,"Shouldn’t you be training, too?"
2378,3,0,SAM,"Well, I’m hardly a new recruit. How many brothers can say they’ve killed a white walker and a Thenn? I might be the first in history! Ser Alliser walks by."
2379,3,0,ALLISER,These men need a firm hand. Always have. They’re poachers and thieves. He gives Sam and Gilly a look.
2380,3,0,ALLISER,Not soldiers. He walks away.
2381,3,0,GILLY,That one hates me.
2382,3,0,SAM,If Ser Alliser is chosen as the new Lord Commander… he hates the wildlings. Sam looks at Gilly’s baby.
2383,3,0,SAM,All the wildlings.
2384,3,0,GILLY,Don’t let them send us away.
2385,3,0,SAM,"It’s not a sure thing. Ser Denys Mallister has commanded the Shadow Tower for 20 years, and people say he’s a good man. He’s running against Ser Alliser--"
2386,3,0,GILLY,Sam! Don’t let them send us away.
2387,3,0,SAM,"I told you. Wherever you go, I go, too."
2388,3,0,GILLY,"You can’t leave, they’ll execute you. Cut back to Jon and Olly parrying. Olly is on the offensive."

2393,3,0,MELISANDRE,Feel. Jon feels her face.
2394,3,0,MELISANDRE,Are you a virgin?
2395,3,0,JON,No.
2396,3,0,MELISANDRE,Good. EXT. THE WALL
2397,3,0,MELISANDRE,Your grace. The bastard of Winterfell. Jon bows to Stannis. Stannis motions for him to get up.
2398,3,0,STANNIS,You know who rules at Winterfell now?
2399,3,0,JON,Roose Bolton.
2400,3,0,STANNIS,The traitor who plunged a dagger into Robb Stark’s heart. Don’t you want to avenge him?
2401,3,0,JON,"I want a great many things, your grace. But I’m a sworn brother of the Night’s Watch now."
2402,3,0,DAVOS,I’ve been talking to your sworn brothers. Many of them love you.
2403,3,0,JON,They’re good men.
2404,3,0,DAVOS,Many don’t. You were seen taking the body of a wildling girl north of the Wall. Why?
2405,3,0,JON,It’s where she belonged.
2406,3,0,DAVOS,Some of the Night’s Watch feel you have too much affection for the wildlings.
2407,3,0,JON,They were born on the wrong side of the wall. That doesn’t make them monsters.
2408,3,0,STANNIS,No matter. I shall take back the North from the thieves who stole it. Tywin Lannister is dead. He can’t protect them now. I shall mount Roose Bolton’s head on a spike. But if I’m to take Winterfell I’ll need more men.
2409,3,0,JON,The men of the Night’s Watch are sworn to play no part--
2410,3,0,STANNIS,I’m not talking about the damn Night’s Watch. I’m talking about the wildlings.
2411,3,0,JON,"Your grace, you want the wildlings to march in your army?"
2412,3,0,STANNIS,"If they swear to follow me, I’ll pardon them. We’ll take Winterfell. Once the North is won, I’ll declare them citizens of the realm. I’ll give them land to live on."
2413,3,0,DAVOS,It’s a fair offer. More than fair.
2414,3,0,STANNIS,I’ll offer them their lives and their freedom if Mance kneels before me and swears his loyalty.
2415,3,0,JON,I don’t think that’s likely.
2416,3,0,STANNIS,"You admire him, don’t you?"
2417,3,0,JON,I respect him.
2418,3,0,STANNIS,He likes you. Convince him to bend the knee...
2419,3,0,JON,Your grace…
2420,3,0,STANNIS,...or he burns.
2421,3,0,JON,How much time do I have?
2422,3,0,STANNIS,"Nightfall. The sun drops fast this time of year. Hurry, Jon Snow."

2429,3,0,BAELISH,Some boys develop more slowly. He’s still young.
2430,3,0,ROYCE,He’s 13. Boys go to war at 13.
2431,3,0,BAELISH,He has other gifts.
2432,3,0,ROYCE,Does he?
2433,3,0,BAELISH,The gift of a great name. Sometimes that’s all one needs. He offers his hand to Sansa and takes her away from the swordfight. Lord Royce follows.
2434,3,0,SANSA,"Goodbye Lord Royce, and thank you for all you’ve done for me."
2435,3,0,ROYCE,"I have done nothing more than my duty, my lady."
2436,3,0,BAELISH,"I have no doubt that upon my return, Robin’s skills will have improved immeasurably."

2440,3,0,BRIENNE,Us? The only reason you’re here is that Jaime Lannister told me you weren’t safe in the capital. You’re hundreds of miles from King’s Landing. No one knows what you look like. No one cares. You’re safe.
2441,3,0,PODRICK,But I’m you’re squire.
2442,3,0,BRIENNE,Do you even know what a squire is?
2443,3,0,PODRICK,An attendant to a knight?
2444,3,0,BRIENNE,I’m not a knight. That means you’re not a squire.
2445,3,0,PODRICK,"Well, where would I go?"
2446,3,0,BRIENNE,"I don’t care, I’m not your mother."
2447,3,0,PODRICK,You swore to find the Stark girls.
2448,3,0,BRIENNE,I found Arya. She didn’t want my protection.
2449,3,0,PODRICK,Sansa still might.
2450,3,0,BRIENNE,Will you shut your mouth? I didn’t ask for advice. I don’t want anyone following me. I’m not a leader. All I ever wanted is to fight for a Lord I believed in. The good lords are dead and the rest are monsters. A horse and carriage rides by. INT. CARRIAGE
2451,3,0,SANSA,You told Lord Royce we were going to the Fingers.
2452,3,0,BAELISH,I did.
2453,3,0,SANSA,But we’re heading west.
2454,3,0,BAELISH,We are.
2455,3,0,SANSA,"If he wanted to betray us, he already would have."
2456,3,0,BAELISH,"Lord Royce may be as honorable as he thinks he is, but he’s not alone in that castle. Do you trust all those knights and ladies, stable boys and serving girls?"
2457,3,0,SANSA,No. Do you trust the carriage driver or the knights escorting us? Baelish smiles.
2458,3,0,BAELISH,"No. But I pay them well, and they’ve seen what happens to men who disappoint me."
2459,3,0,SANSA,So where are we going? To a land where you trust everyone?
2460,3,0,BAELISH,"So a land so far from here, even Cersei Lannister can’t get her hands on you."
2461,3,0,TO,KING’S LANDING Close-up on Cersei drinking wine while Loras talks in the background.
2462,3,0,LORAS,"It was such a deep, deep shock to us all. Your father was a force to be reckoned with. He truly was. I wouldn’t presume to claim to have known him as such… Cut to Tommen talking and smiling with Margaery."
2463,3,0,LORAS,But just being in his presence was enough to make it so clear just how formidable a person you were dealing with. What a… what a force to be reckoned with. CERSEI (sighs): Thank you so much for your kind words. Cersei walks away and heads down the stairs.
2464,3,0,PYRCELLE,"Deepest condolences, your grace. This tragedy… I never trusted Varys. I often warned… Cersei walks away from him. A barefooted man in a robe walks up to Cersei."
2465,3,0,LANNISTER,Your grace. Cersei inspects him for a moment.
2466,3,0,CERSEI,Cousin Lancel. I hardly recognized you.
2467,3,0,LANCEL,My deepest sympathies.
2468,3,0,LANNISTER,I apologize for my son’s appearance.
2469,3,0,CERSEI,"Uncle, it’s quite alright. Lancel walks away."
2470,3,0,KEVAN,"They call themselves sparrows. Bloody fanatics. Religion has its place, of course, but at a certain point… They never would have come to the capital when Tywin was alive."
2471,3,0,CERSEI,I’m sure he’ll grow out of it. Whatever it is. Excuse me.
2472,3,0,KEVAN,"Of course. Cersei walks away, grabs a glass of wine, and heads to a room alone. Lancel greets her after some time."
2473,3,0,CERSEI,Your wounds from the Blackwater seem to have healed.
2474,3,0,LANCEL,It wasn’t my wounds that needed healing.
2475,3,0,CERSEI,What can I do for you?
2476,3,0,LANCEL,You can forgive me.
2477,3,0,CERSEI,What could you possibly have done to warrant my forgiveness?
2478,3,0,LANCEL,I led you into the darkness.
2479,3,0,CERSEI,I doubt you’ve ever led anyone anywhere.
2480,3,0,LANCEL,"I tempted you into our unnatural relations. And, of course, there was the king. His boar hunt. His wine."
2481,3,0,CERSEI,I don’t know what you’re talking about.
2482,3,0,LANCEL,"I’m a different person now. I found peace in the light of the Seven. You can too. They watch over all of us, ready to dole out mercy… or justice. Their world is at hand. I will pray for your father’s soul. Cersei laughs."
2483,3,0,CERSEI,The day Tywin Lannister’s soul needs your help… Cersei takes a sip of wine and Lancel walks away.
2484,3,0,TO,LORAS’ BEDROOM Close-up of Loras' birth mark.
2485,3,0,OLYVAR,It looks like Dorne.
2486,3,0,LORAS,No it doesn’t.
2487,3,0,OLYVAR,It does. That’s the Sunspear bit right there. And that’s where the mountains are. And over here is… Sunsnake? Stonespear?
2488,3,0,LORAS,Sandstone.
2489,3,0,OLYVAR,"Yes. Yes, Sandstone. Just there."
2490,3,0,LORAS,Fine. They start kissing.
2491,3,0,LORAS,It’s Dorne.
2492,3,0,OLYVAR,We should go there. I think we would have a lovely time.
2493,3,0,LORAS,"Judging by my experience, that would be wonderful. Dorne, Highgarden. Anywhere but here. They kiss. Margaery walks in."
2494,3,0,MARGAERY,We’re late for dinner as it is.
2495,3,0,LORAS,You’re very respectful.
2496,3,0,MARGAERY,I’m very hungry. She closes the door.
2497,3,0,MARGAERY,What’s your name?
2498,3,0,OLYVAR,"Olyvar, my lady."
2499,3,0,MARGAERY,"I’m afraid my brother is keeping the king waiting, Olyvar. Olyvar kisses Loras then leaves the room."
2500,3,0,MARGAERY,Perhaps you might consider being a bit more discreet?
2501,3,0,LORAS,Why? They all know about me anyway. Everybody knows everything about everyone. What’s the point in trying to keep a secret in a place like this?
2502,3,0,MARGAERY,In any event… (throws Loras his clothes) you shouldn’t keep your intended waiting.
2503,3,0,LORAS,My intended? Please. Tywin’s dead. That means no one can force Cersei to marry me.
2504,3,0,MARGAERY,Lucky you.
2505,3,0,LORAS,Unlucky you.
2506,3,0,MARGAERY,You think I want that woman married to my brother?
2507,3,0,LORAS,"If she doesn’t marry me, she doesn’t go to Highgarden. Which means she stays in King’s Landing. Which means you’re trapped here with Cersei Lannister as your mother-by-law."
2508,3,0,MARGAERY,Perhaps.
2509,3,0,LORAS,Perhaps?
2510,3,0,MARGAERY,Perhaps?
2511,3,0,TO,PENTOS Tyrion is standing on a balcony with a glass of wine. Varys approaches him.

2514,3,0,VARYS,There are faster ways to kill yourself.
2515,3,0,TYRION,Not for a coward.
2516,3,0,VARYS,"You are many things, my friend, but not a coward."
2517,3,0,TYRION,You never told me why you set me free.
2518,3,0,VARYS,Your brother asked me to.
2519,3,0,TYRION,You could have said no.
2520,3,0,VARYS,Refuse the Kingslayer? A dangerous proposition.
2521,3,0,TYRION,"Not as dangerous as releasing me. You risked your life, your position, everything. Why? You’re not family, you owe me nothing."
2522,3,0,VARYS,I didn’t do it for you. I did it for the Seven Kingdoms.
2523,3,0,TYRION,A drunken dwarf will never be the savior of the Seven Kingdoms.
2524,3,0,VARYS,I don’t believe in saviors. I believe men of talent have a role to play in the war to come.
2525,3,0,TYRION,You’re going to have to find another soldier. I’m done with Westeros and Westeros is done with me.
2526,3,0,VARYS,"You have many admirable qualities, self-pity is not one of them. Any fool with a bit of luck can find himself born into power. But earning it for yourself, that takes work."
2527,3,0,TYRION,I’m not well-suited for work.
2528,3,0,VARYS,"I think you are. You have your father’s instinct for politics, and you have compassion."
2529,3,0,TYRION,Compassion? Yes. I killed my lover with my bare hands. I shot my own father with a crossbow.
2530,3,0,VARYS,I never said you were perfect.
2531,3,0,TYRION,What is it you want exactly?
2532,3,0,VARYS,Peace. Prosperity. A land where the powerful do not prey on the powerless.
2533,3,0,TYRION,"Where the castles are made of gingerbread and the moats are filled with blackberry wine. The powerful have always preyed on the powerless, that’s how they became powerful in the first place."
2534,3,0,VARYS,"Perhaps. And perhaps we’ve grown so used to horror we assume there’s no other way. If you sat on the Iron Throne, would you spread misery throughout the land?"
2535,3,0,TYRION,I will never sit on the Iron Throne.
2536,3,0,VARYS,"No, you won’t. But you could help another climb those steps and take that seat. The Seven Kingdoms need someone stronger than Tommen, but gentler than Stannis. A monarch who can intimidate the high lord and inspire the people. A ruler loved by millions with a powerful army and the right family name."
2537,3,0,TYRION,Good luck finding him.
2538,3,0,VARYS,"Who said anything about him? You have a choice my friend. You can stay here at Ilyrio’s palace and drink yourself to death, or you can ride with me to Mereen, meet Daenerys Targaryen, and decide if the world is worth fighting for."

2542,3,0,LORAQ,"The mission to Yunkai was a resounding success. The Wise Masters of Yunkai have agreed to cede power to a council of elders, made up of both the freedmen and the former slaveholders. All matters of consequence will be brought to you for review."
2543,3,0,DAENERYS,Good.
2544,3,0,HIZDAHR,They did ask for some concessions.
2545,3,0,DAENERYS,Concessions?
2546,3,0,HIZDAHR,"Politics is the art of compromise, your grace."
2547,3,0,DAENERYS,I’m not a politician. I’m a queen.
2548,3,0,HIZDAHR,"Forgive me. You’re right, of course. Still, it’s easier to rule happy subjects than angry ones."
2549,3,0,DAENERYS,"I don’t expect the Wise Masters to be happy. Slavery made them rich, I ended slavery."
2550,3,0,HIZDAHR,They do not ask for the return of slavery. They ask for the re-opening of the fighting pits.
2551,3,0,DAENERYS,The fighting pits? Where slaves fought slaves to the death?
2552,3,0,HIZDAHR,"In the new world that you’ve brought to us, free men would fight free men. Daario takes out his sword and smiles at Daenerys."
2553,3,0,HIZDAHR,The pitfighters that you liberated plead for this opportunity. Bring some here and ask them yourself.
2554,3,0,DAENERYS,No fighting pits.
2555,3,0,HIZDAHR,Opening them would show the people of Yunkai and Meereen that you respect their traditions.
2556,3,0,DAENERYS,I do not respect the tradition of human cockfighting.

2560,3,0,DAARIO,You should reopen the fighting pits.
2561,3,0,DAENERYS,What?
2562,3,0,DAARIO,"My mother was a whore, I told you that. She liked to drink pear brandy. The older she got, the less she made selling her body, the more she wanted to drink. So one day when I was 12, she sold me to a slaver she fucked the night before."
2563,3,0,DAENERYS,Why?
2564,3,0,DAARIO,"I was a bad child. I wasn’t big, but I was quick. And I loved to fight. So they sold me to a man in Tolos who trained fighters for the pits. I had my first match when I was 16."
2565,3,0,DAENERYS,"You were sold into slavery, forced to fight to the death for the amusement of the masters, and you’re defending the fighting pits?"
2566,3,0,DAARIO,"I’m only here because of those pits. I learned to fight like a Dothraki screamer, a Norvoshi priest, a Westerosi knight. Soon I was famous. 10,000 men and women screamed my name when I stepped into the pit. I made so much money for my master he set me free when I died. I joined the Second Sons, and then I met you. A long pause."
2567,3,0,DAARIO,"You’re the queen. Everyone’s too afraid of you to speak truth. Everyone but me. You’ve made thousands of enemies all across the world. As soon as they see weakness, they’ll attack. Show your strength here, now."
2568,3,0,DAENERYS,That’s why I have the Unsullied patrolling the streets. DAARIO (scoffs): Anyone with a chest full of gold can buy an army of Unsullied. You’re not the Mother of Unsullied. You’re the Mother of Dragons.
2569,3,0,DAENERYS,I don’t want another child’s bones dropped at my feet. No one’s seen Drogon in weeks. For all I know he’s flown halfway across the world. I can’t control them anymore.

2576,3,0,MANCE,"When we first met you were my prisoner. And now, for our last meeting…"
2577,3,0,JON,This doesn’t have to be our last meeting.
2578,3,0,MANCE,"No, but it will be."
2579,3,0,JON,You know what Stannis wants?
2580,3,0,MANCE,He wants me to bend the knee. And he wants the free folk to fight for him. I’ll give him this much: he’s bold.
2581,3,0,JON,Shouldn’t a king be bold?
2582,3,0,MANCE,"Oh, aye. I respect him. If he gets what he wants, I expect he’ll be a better ruler than the fools sitting on the Iron Throne the last hundred years. But I’ll never serve him."
2583,3,0,JON,You told me you weren’t here to conquer. You told me your people have bled enough.
2584,3,0,MANCE,That’s right. But I don’t want them bleeding for Stannis Baratheon either.
2585,3,0,JON,"You spent your life convincing 90 clans to come together for the first time in history. Thenns and Hornfoots, the ice-river clans, even the giants. A life’s work uniting them. You didn’t do it for power. You didn’t do it for glory. You brought them together to save them because none of them will survive the winter, not if they’re north of the wall. Isn’t their survival more important than your pride?"
2586,3,0,MANCE,Pride? Fuck my pride. This isn’t about that.
2587,3,0,JON,Then bend the knee and save your people.
2588,3,0,MANCE,They followed me because they respected me. Because they believed in me. The moment I kneel for a Southern king that’s all gone.
2589,3,0,JON,And how many tens of thousands are out there right now? How many women? How many children? And you won’t go out and rescue them because why? You’re afraid of looking afraid.
2590,3,0,MANCE,"Oh, I am afraid. No shame in that. How will they do it? Beheading? Hanging?"
2591,3,0,JON,They’ll burn you alive.
2592,3,0,MANCE,"Bad way to go. I’ll be honest with you, I don’t want to die. And burnt to death, I don’t want people to remember me like that. Scorched and screaming. But it’s better than betraying everything I believe."
2593,3,0,JON,"And what happens to your people? You preserve your dignity and die standing, and they’ll sing songs about you. “You’d rather burn than kneel. The great hero.” Until winter comes, and the white walkers come for us all, and there’s no one left to sing."
2594,3,0,MANCE,"You’re a good lad. Truly, you are. But if you can’t understand why I won’t enlist my people in a foreigner’s war, there’s no point explaining. Jon walks to the door, then turns around."
2595,3,0,JON,I think you’re making a terrible mistake.
2596,3,0,MANCE,The freedom to make my own mistakes was all I ever wanted. Jon nods then leaves the room. EXT. CASTLE BLACK - NIGHT Members of the Night’s Watch escort Mance to Stannis.

2598,3,0,STANNIS,Kneel and live.
2599,3,0,MANCE,This was my home for many years. I wish you good fortune in the wars to come. Stannis nods. His men take Mance onto the burning funeral pyre and tie him to it. Melisandre walks to the front of the pyre.

2603,3,1,ARYA,He's just a statue. A horn blows as they approach the statue. Arya clutches her chest and the man laughs.
2604,3,1,MAN,Don't be afraid. He’s announcing our arrival.
2605,3,1,ARYA,I'm not afraid. Boat goes under statue EXT. BRAAVOS - RAGMAN HARBOR Arya and the man are in a row boat. The man rows them to shore as they pass various street merchants. The man rows past them and The House of Black and White comes into view.

2607,3,1,MAN,"Here, I leave you. He helps Arya get off the boat and onto the dock."
2608,3,1,ARYA,Thank you for bringing me.
2609,3,1,MAN,Any man of Braavos would have done the same. Valar morghulis.
2610,3,1,ARYA,"Valar dohaeris. Arya knocks on the door, twice; the door opens while knocking the second time. An old man enters"

2612,3,1,ARYA,Jaqen H’ghar gave me this.
2613,3,1,MAN,No one here by that name. The old man is about to close the door before Arya interrupts.
2614,3,1,ARYA,Please. I crossed the Narrow Sea. I have nowhere else to go.

2619,3,1,PODRICK,Must be good food if it’s crowded. INT. THE VALE - INN Podrick and Brienne are seated at a table. A waitress approaches.
2620,3,1,WAITRESS,Ale? (pours ale and leaves table; goes to another table) Ale? Cut to another table in the inn: Sansa and Littlefinger's
2621,3,1,SANSA,"Before we left, a maester gave you a raven scroll."
2622,3,1,BAELISH,You are becoming an observant young lady.
2623,3,1,SANSA,"My mother used to say, ""dark wings, dark words""."
2624,3,1,BAELISH,An old saying. Inaccurate in this case.
2625,3,1,SANSA,So it was good news.?
2626,3,1,BAELISH,My marriage proposal has been accepted.
2627,3,1,SANSA,I thought you still mourn the death of my beloved Aunt Lysa.
2628,3,1,WAITRESS,Ale?
2629,3,1,SANSA,I'll have some. Back to Podrick and Brienne
2630,3,1,PODRICK,My lady!
2631,3,1,BRIENNE,What is it?
2632,3,1,PODRICK,Sansa Stark. (Brienne begins to turn around) Don't look!
2633,3,1,BRIENNE,You sure?
2634,3,1,PODRICK,"She's dyed her hair, but it's her. She's sitting with Petyr Baelish."
2635,3,1,BRIENNE,Littlefinger?
2636,3,1,PODRICK,A bunch of knights with him. BRIENNE Bunch? What's a bunch? 100? 6? 20?
2637,3,1,PODRICK,"10, I think. Too many. My lady, I don't think this is the right--"
2638,3,1,BRIENNE,Ready the horses.
2639,3,1,PODRICK,We only have one horse.
2640,3,1,BRIENNE,Find more. Podrick gets up and leaves
2641,3,1,BAELISH,Do you like the taste?
2642,3,1,SANSA,I don't see what all the fuss is about. Why do men love it so much?
2643,3,1,BAELISH,It gives some men courage.
2644,3,1,SANSA,Does it give you courage? Brienne shows up and Baelish's knights get in her way
2645,3,1,GUARD,That's far enough.
2646,3,1,BRIENNE,"Lord Baelish, Lady Sansa, my name is Brienne of Tarth."
2647,3,1,BAELISH,"We've met. With Renly Baratheon. What did he say about you? He said, ""You're a loyalty comes free of charge."" Someone appears to have paid quite a bit for it since then. Baelish gestures to the knights to welcome her; Brienne goes through and takes a knee in front of Sansa"
2648,3,1,BRIENNE,"Lady Sansa, before your mother's death, I was her sworn sword. I gave my word I would find you and protect you. I will shield your back and keep your council, and give my life for yours if need be. I swear it by the old gods and the new."
2649,3,1,BAELISH,"Please, Lady Brienne. No need for such formality. (Brienne gets up) You are Catelyn Stark's sworn sword?"
2650,3,1,BRIENNE,I was.
2651,3,1,BAELISH,Strange. I knew Cat from the time we were children. She never mentioned you.
2652,3,1,BRIENNE,It was after Renly's murder.
2653,3,1,BAELISH,"Ah, yes. You were accused of killing him."
2654,3,1,BRIENNE,I tried to save him.
2655,3,1,BAELISH,But you were accused.
2656,3,1,BRIENNE,By men who didn't see what happened.
2657,3,1,BAELISH,Then what did happen?
2658,3,1,BRIENNE,He was murdered by a shadow. A shadow with a face of Stannis Baratheon.
2659,3,1,BAELISH,A shadow? With a face? (scoffs) This woman swore to protect Renly; she failed. She swore to protect your mother; she failed. Why would I want somebody with your history of failure guiding Lady Sansa?
2660,3,1,BRIENNE,Why should you have any say in her affairs?
2661,3,1,BAELISH,"Because I am her uncle. I married her Aunt Lysa shortly before my beloved’s untimely death. We're family now, and you're an outsider. Forgive me, Lady Brienne, but experiences made me wary of outsiders."
2662,3,1,BRIENNE,"Lady Sansa, if we can have a word alone--"
2663,3,1,SANSA,No.
2664,3,1,BRIENNE,"Please, my lady. If I could explain--"
2665,3,1,SANSA,I saw you at Joffrey's wedding bowing to the king.
2666,3,1,BRIENNE,Neither of us wanted to be there. Sometimes we don't have a choice.
2667,3,1,SANSA,And sometimes we do. You should leave.
2668,3,1,BAELISH,We don't want our new friend wandering the countryside alone. The roads of these parts aren't safe. Why don't you stay? Brienne walks away KNIGHT 1: He asked you to stay. Brienne elbows him in the face after Knight 1 and Knight 2 attempt to get in her way. Brienne rushes out of the inn to the stables. She frees some horses then rides away with Podrick.
2669,3,1,GUARD,After her! EXT. VALE - WOODS The knights chase after Brienne and Podrick. Podrick and Brienne separate.
2670,3,1,BRIENNE,Podrick! (Podrick screams as he loses control of the horse) Podrick gets away from the knights and stops at a river
2671,3,1,PODRICK,"Stop, stop, stop! (Horse stops) That’s a good boy. Podrick turnsthe horse around and he loses control again, only this time he falls off the horse. He tries to run after it, but stops. Enter knight, who sees Podrick. Podrick sees him and throws a rock at him and misses."
2672,3,1,KNIGHT,I guess that means you’re unarmed. Knight pulls out his sword and races towards Podrick.
2673,3,1,BRIENNE,"Down, Podrick, down! Podrick gets down. Brienne slices the knight off his horse before he can get to Podrick. Another knight on a horse rushes towards her, and she stabs him in the neck."
2674,3,1,BRIENNE,Podrick?
2675,3,1,PODRICK,"Yes, my lady?"
2676,3,1,BRIENNE,You can stand now.
2677,3,1,PODRICK,"Yes, my lady. (stands) Sansa Stark?"
2678,3,1,BRIENNE,"Wary of strangers, as she should me. I saw her riding on the East Trail with Littlefinger. We’ll follow them."
2679,3,1,PODRICK,"My lady, if those Stark girls refused your service, maybe you’re released from your vow."
2680,3,1,BRIENNE,I swore to their mother I’d protect those girls.
2681,3,1,PODRICK,If they don’t want your protection--
2682,3,1,BRIENNE,Do you think she’s safe from Littlefinger?
2683,3,1,PODRICK,"(pause) No, my lady."

2685,3,1,JAIME,"A summons from the queen. Cersei looks farefully at a box on her desk. Jaime opens it, and a viper with a necklace in its mouth comes out. Jaime inspects the necklace; it has the Lannister lion on it."
2686,3,1,CERSEI,There are only two like it in the world: the one I’m wearing and the one I gave to Myrcella.
2687,3,1,JAIME,It’s a threat.
2688,3,1,CERSEI,"Of course it’s a threat! Our daughter’s in Dorne surrounded by people who hate our family. (mocking) ""It's a threat."""
2689,3,1,JAIME,No note.
2690,3,1,CERSEI,"They blame us for the death of Oberyn and his sister, and every other tragedy that’s befallen their cursed country. I will burn their cities to the ground if they touch her!"
2691,3,1,JAIME,Softer.
2692,3,1,CERSEI,What?
2693,3,1,JAIME,Not so loud.
2694,3,1,CERSEI,"Our daughter’s in danger, and you’re worried I’m speaking too loudly!"
2695,3,1,JAIME,The world can't know knows she’s our daughter.
2696,3,1,CERSEI,Then don’t call her your daughter. You’ve never been a father to her.
2697,3,1,JAIME,"If I was the father to any of my children, they’d be stoned in the streets."
2698,3,1,CERSEI,And what has your caution brought? Our eldest child murdered at his own wedding. Our only daughter shipped off to Dorne. Our baby boy sent to marry that smirking whore from Highgarden.
2699,3,1,JAIME,I’ll make things better.
2700,3,1,CERSEI,You never made anything better.
2701,3,1,JAIME,I’m going to Dorne. I’ll bring our daughter home.
2702,3,1,CERSEI,You can’t just ask Prince Doran to give her back! She’s promised his son.
2703,3,1,JAIME,I’m not going to ask him anything.
2704,3,1,CERSEI,"You go there with an army, it’s an act of war."
2705,3,1,JAIME,No army. Do you know where they’re keeping her?
2706,3,1,CERSEI,Oberyn mentioned the Water Gardens.
2707,3,1,JAIME,"I’ll find her. Is there anything else, your grace?"
2708,3,1,CERSEI,(scoffs) You’re going to Dorne? A one-handed man? Alone?
2709,3,1,JAIME,I never said I was going alone. (exit Jaime) EXT. THE CROWNLANDS - SHORE Bronn is skipping stones.
2710,3,1,STOKEWORTH,"No sunflowers. I don't like yellow. Roses are very nice, definitely roses. And music. I adore music. But no flutes, I hate flutes! We can have a harp if you like, but no flutes. Then there's the food. Food is the most important thing, don't you agree? We're going to need pigeon pies. That's what they eat in the capital, don't they? Bronn has been skipping stones and ignoring her."
2711,3,1,LOLLYS,Don't they?
2712,3,1,BRONN,Don't who?
2713,3,1,LOLLYS,People eat pigeon pie in the capital. Bronn puts his arm around her.
2714,3,1,BRONN,"They certainly do, my dear. They certainly do. Pan up to Castle Stokeworth."
2715,3,1,BRONN,"It's a fine place, isn't it? A fine place. I never thought I'd end up settling down in a place like this."
2716,3,1,LOLLYS,You won't.
2717,3,1,BRONN,Pardon?
2718,3,1,LOLLYS,"We won't get to live at Stokeworth. When Mother dies, my sister gets the castle because she's older."
2719,3,1,BRONN,Oh.
2720,3,1,LOLLYS,"She hates me. She calls me mean names, and sometimes even still she pulls my hair when Mother isn't looking."
2721,3,1,BRONN,You know what I think? I think you're a good person. And your sister is a mean person.
2722,3,1,LOLLYS,She is.
2723,3,1,BRONN,"I've been all over the world. And if there's one thing I've learned, it's that meanness comes around. People like your sister, they always get what's coming to them eventually. One way or another. They stop walking. Bronn looks at someone in the distance."
2724,3,1,LOLLYS,"Who's that? Jaime is sitting on a stone wall, waiting for Bronn."
2725,3,1,BRONN,Jaime fucking Lannister. Bronn leaves Lollys and starts walking towards Jaime.
2726,3,1,BRONN,Ser Jaime.
2727,3,1,JAIME,Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.
2728,3,1,BRONN,I was very sorry to hear about your father.
2729,3,1,JAIME,"Thank you. BRONN (gestures to Lollys): This is my betrothed, Lollys."
2730,3,1,JAIME,A pleasure. (he kisses her hand)
2731,3,1,BRONN,"Run along, love. Lollys starts walking back to the Castle."
2732,3,1,JAIME,Beautiful bride you've chosen. When were you planning on getting married?
2733,3,1,BRONN,Just get on with it.
2734,3,1,JAIME,On with what?
2735,3,1,BRONN,What you're here for. There's no way this little visit could possibly mean anything good for me.
2736,3,1,JAIME,It's very good for you. Jaime goes into his coat and pulls out a scroll. He hands it to Bronn.
2737,3,1,BRONN,Lollys will be marrying Ser Wyllis Bracken.
2738,3,1,JAIME,Mmm.
2739,3,1,BRONN,"We made a deal, your sister and I."
2740,3,1,JAIME,I would have advised against that.
2741,3,1,BRONN,How is this good for me?
2742,3,1,JAIME,"'Cause you're going to come with me and help me with something important. And when we return, I'm going to give you a much better girl, and a much better castle."
2743,3,1,BRONN,Return from where?
2744,3,1,JAIME,As far south as south goes. EXT. DORNE - WATER GARDENS Ellaria coils her first in rage. A bracelet with a viper's mouth coils around her hand. The camera pans up to reveal she is still in mourning clothes. TRYSTANE (O.S.): My future queen. Ellaria glowers from the balcony at Trystane Martell escorting Myrcella through the Water Gardens. Trystane looks up and sees her. Ellaria walks towards Doran's place on the balcony and is blocked by Areo Hotah.
2745,3,1,AREO,The prince does not wish to be disturbed.
2746,3,1,ELLARIA,"Remove myself from my path, or I'll take that long axe and shove it--"
2747,3,1,DORAN,"Captain. Let her pass. Areo reluctantly steps to the side. Ellaria approaches Prince Doran, staring at the Water Gardens from his wheelchair."
2748,3,1,ELLARIA,"Your brother was murdered, and you sit here at the Water Gardens, staring at the sky and doing nothing."
2749,3,1,DORAN,"Oberyn was slain during a trial by combat. By law, that is not murder."
2750,3,1,ELLARIA,Your brother--
2751,3,1,DORAN,You don't have to remind me. He was my brother long before he was anything to you.
2752,3,1,ELLARIA,What will you do about his death.
2753,3,1,DORAN,I will bury him. I will mourn for him.
2754,3,1,ELLARIA,You would have me go to war?
2755,3,1,DORAN,You would have me go to war?
2756,3,1,ELLARIA,The whole country would have you go to war.
2757,3,1,DORAN,Then we are lucky the whole country does not decide.
2758,3,1,ELLARIA,The Sand Snakes are with me. They have the love of their people. They will avenge your father while you sit here in your chair doing nothing. Doran says nothing. Cut back to Trystane and Myrcella in the Water Gardens.
2759,3,1,ELLARIA,"Oberyn is dead. And this Lannister girl skips about the Water Gardens eating our food, breathing our air. How many of your brothers and sisters do they have to kill? Let me have her. Let me send her to Cersei one finger at a time."
2760,3,1,DORAN,I loved my brother. And you made him very happy. For that you will always have a place in my heart. But we do not mutilate little girls for vengeance. Not here. Not while I rule.
2761,3,1,ELLARIA,And how long will that be? Ellaria exits the room. Areo goes back to guarding the door. Doran shakes his head. EXT. MEEREEN - STREET The Unsullied march through the street. DAARIO (O.S.): The Unsullied are too conspicuous. Daario and Grey Worm are walking through an alley together.
2762,3,1,DAARIO,"Anyone can see you coming from a mile off. Of course you haven't found any Sons of the Harpy. You haven't, have you? Grey Worm grunts a ""no""."
2763,3,1,DAARIO,"My Second Sons, on the other hand, they drink, they whore, fight in the streets--they blend in. They overhear things in taverns, follow people from the taverns to nice, quiet alleys, break a few fingers, overhear a few more things. Before you know it... Daario has brought them to a door. Grey Worm knocks it in and rushes the room. He, Daario, and an Unsullied inspect the room quietly."
2764,3,1,WORM,No one here. We go.
2765,3,1,DAARIO,In a hurry? You're afraid?
2766,3,1,WORM,Unsullied fear nothing.
2767,3,1,DAARIO,"Right. That's your problem. You understood fear once, long ago, but you've forgotten what it means. Someone who's forgotten fear has forgotten how to hide. Daario quickly pulls a dagger out, and stabs into a wall covered by a bookcase that immediately gives way. A man screams and falls out of the wall."
2768,3,1,DAARIO,Fear is useful that way. He pats Grey Worm on the shoulder. The Unsullied soldier grabs the man. Grey Worm searches the hiding place and finds daggers laying on the ground with a Sons of the Harpy mask. INT. MEEREEN - PYRAMID
2769,3,1,MOSSADOR,"Sons of the Harpy, they want to put a collar back on my neck. On all of our necks. Please, Your Grace, you must kill him."
2770,3,1,DAENERYS,It would send a message.
2771,3,1,BARRISTAN,"I think you should exercise restraint, Your Grace."
2772,3,1,DAENERYS,Why?
2773,3,1,BARRISTAN,"For one thing, he may have valuable information."
2774,3,1,DAARIO,The Son of the Harpy has no more valuable information.
2775,3,1,BARRISTAN,How do you know that?
2776,3,1,DAARIO,Because I questioned him.
2777,3,1,HIZDAHR,"And the information you did get, he is young and poor."
2778,3,1,MOSSADOR,He is born free.
2779,3,1,HIZDAHR,Why should he want to bring back slavery? What did it do for him?
2780,3,1,DAENERYS,Perhaps the only thing that gave him pride was knowing that there was someone lower than he was.
2781,3,1,MOSSADOR,They pay him. Great families afraid to do a thing. They pay poor man to do it for them.
2782,3,1,HIZDAHR,And how do you know this?
2783,3,1,MOSSADOR,Everyone knows this.
2784,3,1,HIZDAHR,"I don't know it, and I'm the head of a great family."
2785,3,1,BARRISTAN,"We do not know what this man did or didn't do. (to Daenerys) Give him a trial, at least. A fair trial. Show all of the citizens of Meereen that you are better than those who would depose. Teach them a better way."
2786,3,1,MOSSADOR,"I do not know the place from where Old Ser comes. Things maybe are different there, I hope. But here, in Meereen, before Daenerys Stormborn, they own us. So we learn much about them or we do not live long. They teach me what they are. Mercy, fair trial: these mean nothing to them. All they understand is blood! They all look to Daenerys."
2787,3,1,DAENERYS,Thank you all for your counsel. Everyone gets up from the table and exits the room besides Ser Barristan.
2788,3,1,BARRISTAN,"Your Grace, a word, please, I beg you."
2789,3,1,DAENERYS,About what?
2790,3,1,BARRISTAN,About your father. About the Mad King.
2791,3,1,DAENERYS,The Mad King? You're here to remind me of my enemies' lies? Consider me reminded.
2792,3,1,BARRISTAN,"Your Grace, I served in his Kingsguard. I was at his side from the first.  Your enemies did not lie."
2793,3,1,DAENERYS,Go on.
2794,3,1,BARRISTAN,"When the people rose in revolt against him, your father set their towns and castles aflame. He murdered sons in front of their fathers. He burned men alive with Wildfire, and laughed as they screamed. And his efforts to stamp out dissent led to rebellion that killed every Targaryen except two."
2795,3,1,DAENERYS,I'm not my father.
2796,3,1,BARRISTAN,"No, Your Grace. Thank the gods. But the Mad King gave his enemies the justice he thought they deserved. And each time it made him feel powerful and right. Until the very end."
2797,3,1,DAENERYS,I will not have the Son of the Harpy executed without a fair trial. BARRISTAN (nods): Your Grace. INT. PENTOS - COUNTRYSIDE - CARRIAGE
2798,3,1,TYRION,There's a bug.
2799,3,1,VARYS,"Yes, best be careful. You might accidentally consume some solid food."
2800,3,1,TYRION,"When I agreed to come with you, did I misrepresent my intentions? (finishes his cup of wine) Besides, what is there for me to do inside this fucking box?"
2801,3,1,VARYS,You don't like it?
2802,3,1,TYRION,I want to take a walk.
2803,3,1,VARYS,You can't. Cersei has offered a lordship to the man who brings her your head.
2804,3,1,TYRION,"She ought to offer her cunt. Best part of her for the best part of me. Well, I suppose a box is as good a place for me as anywhere."
2805,3,1,VARYS,Are we really going to spend the entire road to Volantis talking about the futility of everything?
2806,3,1,TYRION,You're right. No point. (realizing) The road to Volantis? You said we were going to Meereen. What's in Volantis?
2807,3,1,VARYS,The road to Meereen.
2808,3,1,TYRION,And what do you hope to find at the end of the road to Meereen?
2809,3,1,VARYS,I told you. A ruler.
2810,3,1,TYRION,We've already got a ruler. Everywhere has already got a ruler. Every pile of shit on the side of every road has someone's banner hanging from it.
2811,3,1,VARYS,"You were quite good, you know. At ruling. During your brief tenure as Hand."
2812,3,1,TYRION,I didn't rule. I was a servant.
2813,3,1,VARYS,"Still, a man of talent."
2814,3,1,TYRION,Managed to kill a lot of people.
2815,3,1,VARYS,"Yes, but showed great promise in other areas as well."
2816,3,1,TYRION,She wanted me to leave King's Landing. She begged me. I wouldn't go.
2817,3,1,VARYS,Why?
2818,3,1,TYRION,'Cause I liked it. Power. Even as a servant. (takes a drink of wine)
2819,3,1,VARYS,People follow leaders. And they will never follow us. They find us repulsive.
2820,3,1,TYRION,I find us repulsive.
2821,3,1,VARYS,"And we find them repulsive, which is why we surround ourselves with large, comfortable boxes to keep them away. And yet, no matter what we do, people like you and me are never really satisfied inside the box. Not for long."
2822,3,1,TYRION,You're right. Let's go for a walk.
2823,3,1,VARYS,No.
2824,3,1,TYRION,How many dwarves are there in the world? Is Cersei going to kill them all? INT. KING'S LANDING - QYBURN'S ROOM A dwarf head is placed on her desk.
2825,3,1,CERSEI,Not him.
2826,3,1,MERYN,"Are you trying to deceive your Queen? Shall I throw them in a cell, Your Grace?"
2827,3,1,CERSEI,"That won't be necessary, Ser Meryn. I don't want to dissuade the other hunters. Mistakes will be made."
2828,3,1,HUNTERS,"Thank you, Your Grace. Thank you."
2829,3,1,CERSEI,Take the head.
2830,3,1,QYBURN,"Pardon me, Your Grace. I would take it, if you don't mind. It could prove useful for my work."
2831,3,1,CERSEI,Very good. She and Qyburn exit the room.
2832,3,1,QYBURN,"Over there will be fine. MERYN (to hunters): You heard the man. Over there. The hunters pick up the dwarf head. INT. KING'S LANDING - RED KEEP Cersei and Qyburn enter the room, taking the open seats on the small council. Cersei sits at the head of the table."
2833,3,1,KEVAN,You're the Hand of the King?
2834,3,1,CERSEI,"No, Uncle. Clearly it would not be appropriate for a woman to assume that role. I'm merely advising my son until he comes of age and chooses a Hand for himself."
2835,3,1,TYRELL,"Your Grace, I would be willing to serve provisionally as the King's Hand until he becomes old enough--"
2836,3,1,CERSEI,"You're a good man, Lord Tyrell, but I don't imagine you'll have the time. In addition to being Master of Ships, the king has appointed you Master of Coin."
2837,3,1,MACE,"Oh, Your Grace."
2838,3,1,CERSEI,He called your experience and wisdom in financial matters unparalleled . He said he would be honored to have you represent the crown's interests in the same.
2839,3,1,MACE,"The honor is all mine, Your Grace."
2840,3,1,PYCELLE,"Your Grace, in the past on several occasions, a Grand Maester has served as the King's Hand."
2841,3,1,CERSEI,The King has named Qyburn the new Master of Whisperers.
2842,3,1,PYCELLE,"Your Grace, him? This man? This embarrassment to the Citadel? Your Grace, what qualifications can he possibly have for this post?"
2843,3,1,CERSEI,"The qualification of loyalty, Grand Maester. That's far more than the eunuch ever had. Far more than many ever have."
2844,3,1,PYCELLE,"I must say I cannot see-- CERSEI (cutting him off): Uncle Kevan, in light of your position as commander of the Lannister armies, it would please the king if you would serve as his Master of War. No man living better deserves the title."
2845,3,1,KEVAN,That is kind of you to say. I would like to hear it from the king himself.
2846,3,1,CERSEI,The king is very busy at this moment.
2847,3,1,KEVAN,"He should be here, learning what it means to rule."
2848,3,1,CERSEI,"He is learning. On this occasion, in his capacity as ruler, he's asked me to speak on his behalf."
2849,3,1,KEVAN,I returned to the capital to pay my respects to my brother. And to you. And to serve the king. I did not return to the capital to serve as your puppet. To watch you stack the small council with sycophants. (looks to Qyburn) Sending your own brother away so he wouldn't be--
2850,3,1,CERSEI,My brother has left the capital to lead a sensitive diplomatic mission.
2851,3,1,KEVAN,What mission?
2852,3,1,CERSEI,That is not your concern as Master of War.
2853,3,1,KEVAN,I do not recognize your authority to dictate what is and is not my concern. You are the Queen Mother. Nothing more. Kevan gets up from his seat.
2854,3,1,CERSEI,You would abandon your king in his time of need?
2855,3,1,KEVAN,"If he wants to send for me, I will be waiting for him. At Casterly Rock. He exits the room and closes the door. INT. CASTLE BLACK - LIBRARY Shireen runs her finger over the letter ""S"" in her book."
2856,3,1,SHIREEN,Come on. You know this one. It looks like an animal.
2857,3,1,GILLY,Snake. Snake... S! It's an S!
2858,3,1,SHIREEN,"Right, very good! Sam is reading in a different aisle in the library."
2859,3,1,SAM,"Hmm! Did you know that the youngest Lord Commander in history, Osric Stark, was elected at the age of 10? Gilly and Shireen look to him and then back at their book."
2860,3,1,GILLY,"I know ""S""."
2861,3,1,SHIREEN,"You'll learn, I promise. I taught Ser Davos, and old people are terrible at learning new things."
2862,3,1,GILLY,"Well, you're a wonderful teacher. (to Sam) Very patient!"
2863,3,1,SAM,"I only said that the more time you spend practicing, the faster you'll be able to read."
2864,3,1,GILLY,That's alright. We're doing just fine. I'm sure you and Ostrich Stark have a lot to talk about. Sam goes back to his book. GILLY (to Shireen): How old were you when you learned to read?
2865,3,1,SHIREEN,"Three. SAM (interjecting): Three?! Who taught you, your mother?"
2866,3,1,SHIREEN,"No. Old Maester Cressen did. I had a lot of time to practice. My mother kept me inside because... (trails off) GILLY (gently): What do you call it in the South, what happened to your face?"
2867,3,1,SHIREEN,Greyscale. What do you call it north of the Wall?
2868,3,1,GILLY,I don't know. But two of my sisters had it. They both died. How did they cure you?
2869,3,1,SHIREEN,"I don't remember. I was a baby. Lots of people came and tried, I think. Whatever they did, it went away. What happened to your sisters?"
2870,3,1,GILLY,My father made them move out of the keep into the huts outside. None of us were allowed to go near them. But we heard them. Especially at night. They started to sound... not like themselves.
2871,3,1,SAM,Did you ever see them?
2872,3,1,GILLY,"Only once at the end. They were covered with it. Their faces, their arms. They acted like animals. My father had to drag them out to the woods on a rope."
2873,3,1,SHIREEN,What did he do to them in the woods? Gilly is afraid to answer. Selyse enters the room before she can.
2874,3,1,SHIREEN,Mother. SELYSE (to Sam and Gilly): Leave us. SAM (nodding): Your Grace. Sam and Gilly exit the room.
2875,3,1,SELYSE,You need to stay away from that girl.
2876,3,1,SHIREEN,Why?
2877,3,1,SELYSE,She's a wildling.
2878,3,1,SHIREEN,Her name's Gilly. She's nice. I'm teaching her to read.
2879,3,1,SELYSE,She's a wildling. Your father defeated their people. He executed her king for treason. They could strike at him by striking at you.
2880,3,1,SHIREEN,Gilly wouldn't do that.
2881,3,1,SELYSE,You have no idea what people will do. All your books and you still don't know. Selyse exits the library. INT. CASTLE BLACK - STANNIS'S ROOM
2882,3,1,STANNIS,"I ordered Mance Rayder burnt at the stake. You prevented that order from being carried out. You showed mercy to Mance Rayder. A king's word is law. Perhaps you should ask Ser Davos how much mercy I show to lawbreakers. Show too much kindness, people won't fear you. If people don't fear you, they don't follow you."
2883,3,1,JON,"With respect, Your Grace, the free folk will never follow you, no matter what you do. You're the man who burned their king alive."
2884,3,1,STANNIS,Who then? You?
2885,3,1,JON,No. Only one of their own.
2886,3,1,STANNIS,Do you know this wretched girl Lyanna Mormont?
2887,3,1,JON,The Lord Commander's niece.
2888,3,1,STANNIS,"Lady of Bear Island, and a child of 10. I asked her to commit her house to my cause, that's her response."
2889,3,1,JON,"""Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North, whose name is Stark."" (Jon smiles)"
2890,3,1,STANNIS,That amuses you?
2891,3,1,JON,"I apologize, Your Grace. Northerners can be a bit like the free folk. Loyal to their own."
2892,3,1,STANNIS,I know. My brother Robert went on often and loudly about how difficult it was to control them - even with your father's help.
2893,3,1,DAVOS,"Tonight, the Night's Watch elect a new Lord Commander. Ser Alliser Thorne is going to win."
2894,3,1,JON,Most likely.
2895,3,1,DAVOS,Unpleasant man. He thinks you're a traitor. What's your life going to be like on the Wall with Thorne in command?
2896,3,1,JON,"Unpleasant, I expect."
2897,3,1,STANNIS,Your bravery made him look weak. He'll punish you for it. I don't punish men for bravery. I reward them.
2898,3,1,JON,"I don't doubt it, Your Grace. But I'm a brother of the Night's Watch. I've pledged them my life, my honor, my sword. I don't know what I have left to give you."
2899,3,1,STANNIS,You can give me the North.
2900,3,1,JON,"I can't. Even if I wanted to, I'm a bastard. A Snow."
2901,3,1,STANNIS,"Kneel before me. Lay your sword at my feet. Pledge me your service and you'll rise again as Jon Stark, Lord of Winterfell. Jon stares at Stannis deeply without saying a word. INT. CASTLE BLACK - DINING HALL"
2902,3,1,SAM,He'll make you a Stark with the stroke of a pen?
2903,3,1,JON,"It's the first thing I ever remember wanting. I'd daydream that my father would ask the king, and just like that I would never be the bastard of Winterfell again."
2904,3,1,SAM,You deserve this. You do. I couldn't be happier for you.
2905,3,1,JON,I'm going to refuse him. SAM (confused): But you'd be Lord of Winterfell.
2906,3,1,JON,"I swore a vow to the Night's Watch. If I don't take my own word seriously, what sort of Lord of Winterfell would I be? Jon walks away from Sam and takes a seat. ALLISER (O.S.): Crowded. You'd think we were serving venison stew. Maester Aemon rises slowly from the table at the front."
2907,3,1,AEMON,Does anyone wish to speak for candidates before we cast our tokens for the 998th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch? Janos Slynt stands up.
2908,3,1,JANOS,"Ser Alliser Thorne is not just a knight, he's a man of true nobility. He was acting commander when the Wall came under attack, and led us to victory against the wildlings."
2909,3,1,MEN,"Hear, hear."
2910,3,1,JANOS,He's a veteran of 100 battles and has been a defender of the Watch and the Wall almost all of his life. He's the only true choice. Alliser smiles. Men cheer and beat on the tables.
2911,3,1,AEMON,Is there anyone else?
2912,3,1,BROTHER,"Ser Denys Mallister joined the Watch as a boy and has served loyally longer than any other ranger. Through 10 winters he served. As commander of the Shadow Tower, he kept the wildlings away. We could do no better. Men, including Jon, bang their cups on the table, but the reaction is much weaker."
2913,3,1,AEMON,"If there's no one else, we will begin the voting. The triangular tokens count for Ser Alliser Thorne. The square tokens for Ser Denys Mallister. Each brother will--"
2914,3,1,SAM,"Maester Aemon. Every Brother, including Jon, look to Sam at the back of the room in shock."
2915,3,1,AEMON,"Samwell Tarly. Go on. Jon shakes his head ""no"" at Sam. JANOS (O.S.): Sam the Slayer. The whole room laughs."
2916,3,1,JANOS,Another wildling lover just like his friend Jon Snow. How's your lady love Slayer? More laughs.
2917,3,1,SAM,Her name is Gilly. Brother Slynt knows her quite well. They cowered together in the larder during the battle for the Wall. The men start laughing at Janos now.
2918,3,1,JANOS,Lies!
2919,3,1,SAM,"A wildling girl, a baby, and Lord Janos. I found him there when the battle was over in a puddle of his own making. Stronger laughter. Maester Aemon cracks a smile."
2920,3,1,SAM,"Whilst Lord Janos was hiding with the women and children, Jon Snow was leading. The men go quiet."
2921,3,1,SAM,"Ser Alliser fought bravely, it is true. And when he was wounded, it is Jon who saved us. He took charge of the wall's defense. He killed the Magnar of the Thenns. (a man next to Sam nods) He went North to deal with Mance Rayder, knowing it almost certainly meant his own death. Before that, he led the mission to avenge Lord Commander Mormont. Mormont himself chose Jon to be his steward. He saw something in Jon, and now we've all seen it, too. He may be young, but he's the commander we turned to when the night was darkest. The men give Jon a strong cheer."
2922,3,1,ALLISER,"I can't argue with any of that. (stands up) But who does Jon Snow want to command? Night's Watch or the wildlings? Everyone knows he loved a wildling girl and spoke with Mance Rayder many times. What would have happened in that tent between those two old friends if Stannis's army hadn't come along? We all saw him put the King-beyond-the-Wall out of his misery. Do you want to choose a man who has fought the wildlings all his life, or a man who makes love to them? Jon doesn't respond. Maester Aemon rises again."
2923,3,1,AEMON,"It is time. Brothers of the Night's Watch walk to the front of the room, placing their tokens into a jar. A brother breaks the jar and counts the tokens. Alliser and Jon have the same amount of tokens."
2924,3,1,BROTHER,"It appears to be a tie, Maester. Maester Aemon rises once more, feels each stack of tokens to determine which is which, and casts his own vote for Jon. The men near Alliser look angry. The men grouped around Mallister are content. Everyone else cheers."
2925,3,1,BROTHERS,"Jon Snow! Jon Snow! Jon Snow! Jon Snow! Jon rises, sees Alliser glaring at him, and lets out a small smile for the first time since he entered the room. EXT. BRAAVOS - STREETS Arya creeps up on a pigeon in an alleyway and cuts its head off with Needle. She walks down the street with the pigeon in a pouch and Needle dangling from her hip. Three men walk by, see Needle, and approach her."
2926,3,1,MAN,You. You! Arya stops and turns around to face them.
2927,3,1,MAN,What have you got there? Arya doesn't respond.
2928,3,1,MAN,I said--
2929,3,1,ARYA,"Turn around and go. (pulls out Needle) Turn around and go. Man: That's a nice little sword. Worth 100 pieces, a sword like that. (pulls out his own sword)"
2930,3,1,ARYA,"Nothing's worth anything to dead men. The man approaches her with his sword, but then sees the Old Man from the House of Black and White walking towards the altercation and backs off."
2931,3,1,MEN,"Quickly, go, go! They flee. The man looks at Arya then begins walking away. EXT. BRAAVOS - THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE The Old Man leads Arya back to the doorstep."
2932,3,1,ARYA,Who are you? Why were they scared of you?
2933,3,1,MAN,"You lost this. He tosses Arya her coin, then reaches to his face, pulls it off, and reveals the face of Jaqen H'ghar"
2934,3,1,ARYA,You said there was no Jaqen H'ghar here.
2935,3,1,JAQEN,There isn't. A man is not Jaqen H'ghar. He begins to head back inside the House of Black and White.
2936,3,1,ARYA,Well who are you then? He turns back around.
2937,3,1,JAQEN,"No one. And that is who a girl must become. Jaqen opens the door and waits for Arya. After a moment, she follows him into the House of Black and White. The door closes behind them. INT. MEEREEN - PRISON Mossador is let into the Son of the Harpy's cell. The guards hold him up for Mossador. HARPY (Valyrian): She doesn't belong here. And no matter how many of your traitors call her ""Mhysa"", she will never be your mother. Mossador stares at him. EXT. MEEREEN - STREET - DAY The Harpy is displayed in the street with his mask on, but the eye holes are cut out. A knife is in his stomach and skull, and ""Kill the Masters"" is written in blood on the wall next to the body. INT. MEEREEN - PALACE"
2938,3,1,DAENERYS,"Why? MOSSADOR (Valyrian): For you, Mhysa. (kneels) You wanted the Harpy dead, but your hands were tied. I set you free, as you did all of us."
2939,3,1,DAENERYS,"He was our prisoner, awaiting trial. You had no right."
2940,3,1,MOSSADOR,He would rather rip your city apart than see slaves lifted from the dirt.
2941,3,1,DAENERYS,There are no more slaves. There are no more Masters.
2942,3,1,MOSSADOR,"Then who lives in the Pyramids? Who wears gold masks and murders your children? (beat) When Grey Worm came to us, I was the first to take up the knife for you. I remember the look on my father's face as I struck down his Master, who had traded his infant son for a dog. My father died in the fighting. If we allow the Sons of the Harpy to return us to chains, he never lived."
2943,3,1,DAENERYS,"The Harpy's life was not yours to take. Once, the Masters were the law--"
2944,3,1,MOSADOR,--and now you are the law!
2945,3,1,DAENERYS,The law is the law. Take him. Two Unsullieds carry Mossador out of the room. EXT. MEEREEN - DAY The Unsullied escort Daenerys and her small council. A large crowd surrounds them.
2946,3,1,CROWD,"Mhysa! Myhsa! They settle in front of the courthouse, surrounded by both former Masters and former slaves. The Unsullied form a ring around her. HIZDAHR (to Daario): She should have cut off the traitor's head in the Great Pyramid and been done with it."
2947,3,1,DAARIO,"Which is what I keep telling her to do to you. The former slaves continues to yell to their Mhysa while the masters leer at her. DAENERYS (Valyrian, to crowd): You opened your gates to me because I promised you freedom and justice. One cannot exist without the other. Mossador is carried into the scene by Unsullied and set before Daenerys on his knees. CROWD (Valyrian): Brother! Brother! MOSSADOR (Valyrian): Mhysa, please! Forgive me! DAENERYS (Valyrian): A citizen of Meereen was awaiting trial and this man murdered him. The punishment is death. CROWD (Valyrian): Mercy! Mercy! Mossador looks to Daenerys, pleading. She looks to Daario and nods. He takes out his arakh, walks to Mossador, and puts it to his neck. The crowd starts protesting and the Masters look on uncertainly."
2948,3,1,MOSSADOR,"Mhysa... (prays in Valyrian) The crowd begs and pleads for mercy. Daenerys stares out to the crowd, then gives a nod to Daario, who swiftly decapitates Mossador."
2949,3,1,CROWD,"Mhysa... The crowd goes silent. Suddenly, they start hissing at Daenerys. The Unsullied brace themselves. A former slave throws a rock at a former Master, and the Unsullied attempt to hold back the fight. Barristan and Grey Worm escort Missandei and Daenerys away from the crowd. The Unsullied cover her with their shields. Former slaves and masters begin killing each other in the streets. Rocks are thrown at the Unsullied shields in attempts to hit Daenerys. INT. MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID"
2950,3,1,BARRISTAN,"I'll stand guard outside your door tonight, Your Grace."
2951,3,1,WORM,We all guard tonight.
2952,3,2,DEFAULT,High Sparrow Script Lyrics TITLE SEQUENCE
2953,3,2,TO,"BRAAVOS INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE Water drips down a statue of a woman with her eyes closed. Two more statues are shown, a lion sitting in a throne, and a rams head . Behind a large heart surrounded by gold flames, a glowing fire can be seen. A statue of a knight is shown, then a statue of a king’s face. A statue of a contorted tree is covered in a hair-like substance. There is a large pit filled with liquid in the center of the room. Arya can be heard, and then seen, sweeping. The waif carries a bucket past her. Sitting on the edge of the pit, Jaqen whisper to a man. Arya looks up and watches as Jaqen scoops up a cup of liquid from the pit, and hands it to the man. The man looks up at Jaqen, and hesitates before taking it."
2954,3,2,MAN,Valar morghulis.
2955,3,2,JAQEN,"Valar dohaeris. The man drinks the liquid, and watches as he approaches the statue of the woman with her eyes closed. He kneels down in front of it. Arya puts her broom down and approaches Jaqen."
2956,3,2,ARYA,I've been sweeping this floor for days.
2957,3,2,JAQEN,Good.
2958,3,2,ARYA,I didn't come here to sweep floors.
2959,3,2,JAQEN,"No? Why come, then?"
2960,3,2,ARYA,You said that I could be your apprentice. You said you'd teach me how to a Faceless Man.
2961,3,2,JAQEN,"A man teaches a girl. (Stands up). Valar dohaeris. All men must serve. Faceless men, most of all. (Walks away)."
2962,3,2,ARYA,I want to serve. (Jaqen stops).
2963,3,2,JAQEN,"A girl wants to serve herself. Here we serve the Many-Faced God, to serve well. A girl must become no-one."
2964,3,2,ARYA,Which one is the Many-Faced God? I see the Stranger. I see the Drowned God . I see the Weirwood Face.
2965,3,2,JAQEN,"There is only one god. A girl knows his name. And all men know his gift. Jaqen leaves. Arya looks down at the man who had been kneeling. He is lying on his back, dead. Two men come into the room with a stretcher. They places the man’s body on it and begin walking to an open door at the end of the room. The waif walks past Arya."
2966,3,2,ARYA,"Where are they taking him? The waif doesn’t respond, but continues walking. Arya turns to watch as the door closes behind the men carrying the stretcher."
2967,3,2,TO,"KING’S LANDING EXT. STREET Bells are ringing, and people are cheering and shouting. Many are on the sides of the road, waving as a number of carriages are carried past."
2968,3,2,BYSTANDERS,"Queen Margaery! Queen Margaery! Queen Margaery! Inside her carriage, Cersei watches the people on the street, a sullen look on her face. She closes her curtains. INT. GREAT SEPT"
2969,3,2,TOMMEN,"I am his/hers, and she/he is mine. From this day, until the end of my days. Tommen and Margaery share a kiss. Cersei watches them from the crowd, emotionless. The newlyweds turn to the crowd, holding hands. Everyone claps. They smile and laugh. Cersei claps as well, and forces herself to smile. INT. TOMMEN’S CHAMBERS - THAT NIGHT Tommen breathes heavily as he and Margaery finish having sex. She turns onto her side and smiles."
2970,3,2,TOMMEN,Did I hurt you?
2971,3,2,MARGAERY,No. You were lovely.
2972,3,2,TOMMEN,It all happened so fast.
2973,3,2,MARGAERY,Yes. (Chuckles).
2974,3,2,TOMMEN,"I was scared maybe I hurt you, it sounded"
2975,3,2,MARGAERY,"No, no, no. You're very sweet. The sweetest king who ever lived."
2976,3,2,TOMMEN,"This is what I want to do all day, every day for the rest of my life."
2977,3,2,MARGAERY,"Wouldn't that be glorious? (They laugh. Tommen leans in to kiss her). Shouldn't we rest a little while? Just to catch our breath, there's no rush, is there?"
2978,3,2,TOMMEN,Of course not. Are you hungry? Shall I have them bring you some cake or pomegranate juice?
2979,3,2,MARGAERY,"No, I'm fine. I just want you all to myself. I want to know everything there is to know about King Tommen First of His Name."
2980,3,2,TOMMEN,King Tommen. It still sounds strange to me. Does Queen Margaery sound strange to you?
2981,3,2,MARGAERY,So strange… Husband.
2982,3,2,TOMMEN,"Wife. (They laugh). Sometimes it feels odd. I'm the king, I've married the most beautiful woman in the world, (She chuckles), and it's all because my brother died."
2983,3,2,MARGAERY,"I understand. But it's not your fault, you know that, don't you? You mustn't feel guilty."
2984,3,2,TOMMEN,I don't feel guilty. That's what's odd. Margaery looks at him curiously. He suddenly sits up.
2985,3,2,TOMMEN,Do you like to sail?
2986,3,2,MARGAERY,(Sits up). I love to sail.
2987,3,2,TOMMEN,"I do, too."
2988,3,2,MARGAERY,"I think we're going to be very happy, you and I."
2989,3,2,TOMMEN,"I do, too. She kisses him and turns around. She gets up, wrapping a bedsheet around herself as a cover."
2990,3,2,MARGAERY,"Living in a tower so high, it touches the clouds. Of course my grandmother couldn't wait to go home. The capital is not for everyone, I suppose. Does your mother like it here?"
2991,3,2,TOMMEN,I don't think so. She told me never to trust anyone in King's Landing.
2992,3,2,MARGAERY,It's so wonderful to have her watching over you. A lioness guiding her cub. (Pours them some wine).
2993,3,2,TOMMEN,"Well, but I'm a man now."
2994,3,2,MARGAERY,You are. And the king. (Hands him win). But you'll always be her baby-boy.
2995,3,2,TOMMEN,I suppose.
2996,3,2,MARGAERY,"I adore how she has always been so generous with me, so kind. And the horror she's had to injure. (Sits down and begins to comb her hair). Losing her husband, her eldest child and her father. It's no wonder she's so protective of you. She'll never let you out of her sight. EXT. CASTLE WALL Cersei and Tommen walk together, her arm around his. A group of guards walk behind them."
2997,3,2,CERSEI,"You look very much in love. The first days of marriage are often so blissful. She's certainly very pretty, isn't she? Like a doll, she smiles quite a lot. Do you think she's intelligent? I can't quite tell. Not that it matters."
2998,3,2,TOMMEN,Do you ever miss Casterly Rock?
2999,3,2,CERSEI,There's nothing for me in Casterly Rock.
3000,3,2,TOMMEN,That's where you grew up. (They stop). You always told me that you liked the people there better. You said that King's Landing smelled of horse dung and sour milk.
3001,3,2,CERSEI,(Chuckles). Why are we speaking of Casterly Rock?
3002,3,2,TOMMEN,"The way that you talked about it, I always thought that you missed it. That you... That it was your real home."
3003,3,2,CERSEI,This is my real home now. Where my family lives.
3004,3,2,TOMMEN,"I want you to be happy, mother."
3005,3,2,CERSEI,"I know that. I know you do, my sweet boy."
3006,3,2,TOMMEN,"But wouldn't you be happier in Casterly Rock? INT. ROOM Cersei approaches a room with two guards. Inside, Margaery is having tea with some of her friends."
3007,3,2,MARGAERY,"I said, ""Darling, surely 4 times is enough, are you trying to set a new record?"" (Laugher). And he said, ""Well, what is the record? I'm sure we can break it."" Margaery’s friends laugh. As Cersei walks in, they all get up and bow."
3008,3,2,MARGAERY,Mother! (Gets up and hugs Cersei). Welcome.
3009,3,2,CERSEI,Don't you look lovely. Marriage agrees with you.
3010,3,2,MARGAERY,Can we bring you anything to eat or drink? I wish we had some wine for you. It's a bit early in the day for us.
3011,3,2,CERSEI,"No, no. I, I can't stay. I just wanted to let you know if, there is ever anything I can do for you."
3012,3,2,MARGAERY,You are very sweet.
3013,3,2,CERSEI,Tommen seems quite taken with his new queen.
3014,3,2,MARGAERY,I absolutely adore him. You raised a gallant young man. I'm forever grateful.
3015,3,2,CERSEI,Good. Good. I'm glad to hear you're happy.
3016,3,2,MARGAERY,"Ecstatic. I really am. Exhausted, to be honest, but what can I expect, he is half lion, half stag. (Margaery’s friends laugh)."
3017,3,2,CERSEI,I'll leave you to it then. (Turns to leave).
3018,3,2,MARGAERY,"Oh, forgive me, I haven't been at Court for long, I get so confused. What's the proper way to address you now? Queen Mother or Dowager Queen?"
3019,3,2,CERSEI,There's no need for such formalities.
3020,3,2,MARGAERY,"In any event, judging from the King's enthusiasm, the Queen Mother will be a Queen Grandmother soon."
3021,3,2,CERSEI,Won’t that be a lovely day.
3022,3,2,MARGAERY,Can you imagine the celebrations? They'll ring the bells all day and night.
3023,3,2,CERSEI,"Remember. Anything you need. Margaery smiles. Cersei leaves. Margaery’s smile fades. It returns when her friends begin laughing, and she turns back around. Cersei walks away with her two guards, still able to hear the laughter."
3024,3,2,TO,"WINTERFELL EXT. COURTYARD A horse whinnies. Bolton bannermen ride to the keep. In the keep, a number of workmen are busy building and repairing things. Some men carry some raven cages through the middle of the courtyard. Theon, carrying a dead bird, walks through for a moment. He then comes across some soldiers lifting up some flayed bodies with rope. He becomes very tense and forces himself to keep walking, head down. A raven picks at a body in a cart. INT. DINING HALL Roose and Ramsay sit at a table as Theon cuts some food. Ramsay talks with his face stuffed."
3025,3,2,ROOSE,We can't hold the North with terror alone.
3026,3,2,RAMSAY,You can't hold the North if you let these lesser lords insult us.
3027,3,2,ROOSE,"I sent you there to collect taxes, not bodies."
3028,3,2,RAMSAY,"Lord Cerwyn refused to pay. Said the Warden of the North would always be a Stark, and he'd be damned if he kissed a traitor's boot. Theon holds the food in front of Ramsay. He takes some of it and puts it on his plate."
3029,3,2,ROOSE,He left you no choice.
3030,3,2,RAMSAY,"I flayed him living, along with his wife and brother. Made his son watch."
3031,3,2,ROOSE,And?
3032,3,2,RAMSAY,The new Lord Cerwyn paid his taxes.
3033,3,2,ROOSE,"(After a moment). I have something important to tell you. Stop eating and listen. Ramsay, who had been heavily engrossed in his eating, stops suddenly and looks up. Theon slowly puts down a plate nearby. Ramsay puts down his silverware and sits back, looking at his father."
3034,3,2,ROOSE,We don't have enough men to hold the North if the other Houses rise up against us. Do you understand that?
3035,3,2,RAMSAY,Our pact with the Lannisters protects -
3036,3,2,ROOSE,"I had a pact with Tywin Lannister, and Tywin Lannister is dead. The remaining Lannisters are a thousand miles away dealing with that fact. They've never once in the history of the Seven Kingdoms sent their army this far north. If you think they will for us, you're a fool. We become a great house by entering in alliances with other houses, and parleying those alliances into greater power. The best way to forge a lasting alliance isn't by peeling a man's skin off. The best way is marriage. (Stands up). Now that you're a Bolton by royal decree, it's time you married a suitable bride. And as it happens, I found the perfect girl to solidify our hold in the North."
3037,3,2,TO,"MOAT CAILIN EXT. NEARBY HILLS Sansa, Baelish, and a number of knights ride towards Moat Cailin. The party stops. Baelish leads Sansa on foot to a spot where they can easily overlook the keep. The keep is shown, surrounded by swampy riverlands."
3038,3,2,SANSA,That's Moat Cailin.
3039,3,2,BAELISH,"Yes. A bit shabby, isn't it? You've been here before."
3040,3,2,SANSA,"On our way down to King's Landing, with my father and Arya and… where are you taking me?"
3041,3,2,BAELISH,Home.
3042,3,2,SANSA,"The Boltons have Winterfell. (He nods). The marriage proposal, it wasn't for you?"
3043,3,2,BAELISH,(Shakes his head). No.
3044,3,2,SANSA,Roose Bolton murdered my brother. He betrayed my family!
3045,3,2,BAELISH,He did.
3046,3,2,SANSA,He serves the Lannisters.
3047,3,2,BAELISH,For now.
3048,3,2,SANSA,I won't go.
3049,3,2,BAELISH,Winterfell is your home.
3050,3,2,SANSA,Not anymore.
3051,3,2,BAELISH,Always. You're a Stark. Dyeing your hair doesn't change that. You're Sansa Stark. The eldest surviving child of Ned and Catelyn Stark. Your place is in the North.
3052,3,2,SANSA,I can't marry him. You can't make me. He's a traitor. A murderer.
3053,3,2,BAELISH,"You're not marrying Roose Bolton. No, you'll be marrying his son and heir, Ramsay. One day he'll be Warden of the North and you will -"
3054,3,2,SANSA,No!
3055,3,2,BAELISH,Sansa -
3056,3,2,SANSA,"No, you can't make me. I will starve myself. I will die before I have to go there."
3057,3,2,BAELISH,"(Grabbing her). I won't force you to do anything. Don't you know by now how much I care for you? Say the word and we turn the horses round, but listen to me. Listen. (Quietly). You've been running all your life. Terrible things happened to your family and you weep. You sit alone in a darkened room, mourning their fates. You've been a bystander to tragedy from the day they executed your father. Stop being a bystander, do you hear me? Stop running. There's no justice in the world. Not unless we make it. You loved your family. Avenge them. He kisses her forehead. He walks back to their horses. After a few moments, she regains her composure and gets on her horse. The party starts moving again. On top of a large hill nearby, Brienne and Podrick watch as the party arrives at the keep."
3058,3,2,PODRICK,How do we get through there?
3059,3,2,BRIENNE,We don't. We go around. (She turns her horse and begins leaving).
3060,3,2,PODRICK,It sets miles out of the way. We'll lose sight of them.
3061,3,2,BRIENNE,Doesn't matter. I know where they're going. EXT. CAMPSITE Podrick sits scrubbing a boot.
3062,3,2,BRIENNE,Aren't you getting a bit old to be a squire? How did you end up squiring for the Imp?
3063,3,2,PODRICK,He hates that nickname.
3064,3,2,BRIENNE,"Well, he's not here to complain about it, is he? Podrick finishes scrubbing and hands the boot to Brienne. He puts the brush down. Brienne begins putting the boot on."
3065,3,2,PODRICK,"I squired for a knight name Ser Lorimer during the War of the Five Kings. One night, he had a bit too much to drink. And he was famished, so he borrowed a ham."
3066,3,2,BRIENNE,He borrowed it?
3067,3,2,PODRICK,"He wasn't a thief. He was drunk and hungry and he wasn't thinking. I was drunk too. He gave me half the ham. Next morning, one of the guards saw him passed out, under a wagon, with the ham bone still in his hand. They hanged the man afternoon. They tied the noose for me too, but, Lord Tywin heard my family name was Payne. So he pardoned me, and sent me to King's Landing to squire for his son."
3068,3,2,BRIENNE,As punishment. For both of you.
3069,3,2,PODRICK,It didn't seem that way. Lord Tyrion was always very good to me.
3070,3,2,BRIENNE,"(Walks away to get firewood). Yes, all of your lords were very kind to you. All except me. Sorry you have to squire such a nasty person."
3071,3,2,PODRICK,I'm not sorry. You're the best fighter I've ever seen. You beat The Hound. I'm proud to be your squire.
3072,3,2,BRIENNE,I'm sorry I'm always snapping at you.
3073,3,2,PODRICK,If you wouldn't snap at me I wouldn't learn anything.
3074,3,2,BRIENNE,"You want to be a knight, Pod?"
3075,3,2,PODRICK,Yes.
3076,3,2,BRIENNE,"Starting tomorrow, we'll train with the sword twice a day, before we ride in the morning and after we camp for the evening. (Sits down). And I'm going to show you how to ride properly."
3077,3,2,PODRICK,Thank you.
3078,3,2,BRIENNE,"I can't knight you, but I can teach you how to fight."
3079,3,2,PODRICK,"I suppose that's more important. Podrick leans over the campfire with some rocks. He strikes them together until he gets a spark, and blows until the fire starts going. He wipes himself off and stands up, walking over to Brienne. He begins taking her armor off."
3080,3,2,PODRICK,"You weren't a knight, but you were a Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon, weren't you?"
3081,3,2,BRIENNE,I was.
3082,3,2,PODRICK,Lord Tyrion said he was a good man.
3083,3,2,BRIENNE,He was.
3084,3,2,PODRICK,But how did you end up serving Renly?
3085,3,2,BRIENNE,"(After a few moments). When I was a girl, my father held a ball. I'm his only living child, so he wants to make a good match for me. He invited dozens of young lords to Tarth. I didn't want to go, but he dragged me to the ballroom. (Pauses). And it was wonderful. None of the boys noticed how mulish and tall I was. The shoved each other, and threatened to duel if they thought it was their turn to dance. And whispered in my ear how they wanted to marry me and take me back to their castles. (Smiles). My father smiled at me and I smiled at him. I'd never been so happy. (Her smile drops). Till I saw a few of the boys sniggering. And then they all started to laugh, they couldn't keep the game going any longer. They were toying with me. ‘Brienne the Beauty’, they called me. Great joke. And I realized I was the ugliest girl alive. A great lumbering beast. I tried to run away, but Renly Baratheon took me in his arms. “Don't let them see your tears,” he told me. “They’re nasty little shits. The nasty little shits aren't worth crying over.” He danced with me and none of the other boys could say a word. And he was the king's brother after all."
3086,3,2,PODRICK,But wasn't he... Lord Tyrion said he was...
3087,3,2,BRIENNE,"Yes, Pod, he liked men, I'm not an idiot. He didn't love me, he didn't want me, he danced with me because he was kind and he wouldn't see me hurt. He saved me from being a joke. From that day until his last day. And I couldn't save him in return. Nothing's more hateful than failing to protect the one you love. One day, I will avenge King Renly."
3088,3,2,PODRICK,But you said a shadow murdered him. How do you fight a shadow?
3089,3,2,BRIENNE,"A shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon. I know it was Stannis. I know it in my heart. Stannis is a man, not a shadow. And a man can be killed."
3090,3,2,TO,CASTLE BLACK INT. LORD COMMANDER’S ROOM Olly opens the door for Stannis and Davos. Jon sits at his desk.
3091,3,2,STANNIS,Lord Commander.
3092,3,2,JON,(Stands up). Your Grace.
3093,3,2,STANNIS,(To Olly as he closes the door). I'd like to speak alone.
3094,3,2,JON,"Olly is my steward now, as I was Lord Commander Mormont's. I want him to attend my meetings, to learn from men with experience. One day, he might command."
3095,3,2,STANNIS,Very well. (They all sit down). Have you considered my offer?
3096,3,2,JON,I have. And I thank you for it. You do me great honor. All my life I wanted to be Jon Stark.
3097,3,2,STANNIS,Say the word and you will be.
3098,3,2,JON,But I have to refuse you. I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. My place is here.
3099,3,2,STANNIS,I'm giving you a chance to avenge your family. To take back the castle where you grew up. To rule the North.
3100,3,2,JON,"I wish I could fight beside you. Believe me, I do. But I swore a sacred vow at the Godswood. I pledged my life to the Night's Watch."
3101,3,2,STANNIS,You're as stubborn as your father. And as honorable.
3102,3,2,JON,I can imagine no higher praise.
3103,3,2,STANNIS,"I didn't mean it as praise. Honor got your father killed. (Stands up). But if your mind’s made up, I won't try to persuade you."
3104,3,2,JON,"May I ask, Your Grace, how long you plan to stay at Castle Black?"
3105,3,2,STANNIS,Are you bored of us already?
3106,3,2,JON,You saved us from Mance Rayder's army. We will never forget that. But it's a question of survival. The Night's Watch can't continue to feed your men and the wildling prisoners indefinitely. Winter is coming.
3107,3,2,STANNIS,I know it. We march on Winterfell within the fortnight. Before the snows trap us here.
3108,3,2,JON,And the wildlings?
3109,3,2,STANNIS,"They'd rather burn than fight for me, so be it. I leave their fate to you. You could execute them, that's the safest course. (After a moment). Or you could see if this Tormund fellow is more willing to compromise than Mance ever was. I assume the brothers of the Night's Watch would rather see the wildlings dead."
3110,3,2,JON,"Most of the brothers, yes. There's little love for the free folk here. (Olly stares at him)."
3111,3,2,STANNIS,You're the Lord Commander. Your decision. Stannis begins to leave. Olly opens the door.
3112,3,2,STANNIS,You have many enemies in Castle Black. Have you considered sending Alliser Thorne elsewhere? Give him command of  Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.
3113,3,2,JON,I heard it was best to keep your enemies close.
3114,3,2,STANNIS,"Whoever said that didn't have many enemies. Stannis leaves. Davos begins to leave, but turns to Jon as Jon begins to pace."
3115,3,2,DAVOS,"He sees something in you. (Jon looks up). Might not be apparent from his tone, but it's the truth. He believes in you."
3116,3,2,JON,I'm sorry I disappointed him. Davos walks forward and takes a seat. Olly closes the door again.
3117,3,2,DAVOS,The king is a complicated man. But he wants what's right for the Seven Kingdoms.
3118,3,2,JON,As long as he's ruling them.
3119,3,2,DAVOS,He's the one true king. He has the blood right to that throne.
3120,3,2,JON,I’ve sworn to stay clear of the politics of the Seven Kingdoms.
3121,3,2,DAVOS,"Have you now? (Turning to Olly). How does the Night's Watch vow go again? I bet you've got it memorized since you got here. Olly looks to Jon. Jon looks at him, crosses his arms, and nods."
3122,3,2,OLLY,Night gathers and now my watch begins -
3123,3,2,DAVOS,"Not that bit, the bit at the end."
3124,3,2,OLLY,"I'm the sword in the darkness, the watcher on the walls, the shield that guards the realm of men. I pledge my life -"
3125,3,2,DAVOS,"Wait, that's enough. “The shield that guards the realm of men.” That's what you swore to be. Now I'm not a learned man, but the best way of helping the most people might not be sitting in a frozen castle at the edge of the world. It just might mean wading in the muck, getting your boots dirty, and doing what needs to be doing."
3126,3,2,JON,And what needs to be done?
3127,3,2,DAVOS,"As long as the Boltons rule the North, (Stands up), the North will suffer. Just one man's opinion. Davos nods and turns to leave. Olly opens the door for him. Jon sits at his desk and sighs."
3128,3,2,TO,"BRAAVOS INT. ARYA’S ROOM Arya lays on her bed, playing with her coin in her hand. Suddenly, the door opens, and she sits up. The waif enters with a cane, and begins pacing."
3129,3,2,ARYA,What do you want?
3130,3,2,WAIF,Who are you?
3131,3,2,ARYA,What?
3132,3,2,WAIF,"You, who walk in here with a coin you never earned, whose value you do not respect. (Stops and walks to Arya). Who are you?"
3133,3,2,ARYA,"(After a moment, perks up). No one. The waif quickly swings her cane at Arya, hitting her arm. Arya, now on her feet, turns to face the waif, holding her arm in pain."
3134,3,2,ARYA,Ow! Cunt!
3135,3,2,WAIF,"A lie, a sad little lie. Who are you?"
3136,3,2,ARYA,"I told you, I'm no - (Gets hit again). Do that again and - The waif hits her a third time, sending her to the ground."
3137,3,2,WAIF,Who are you?
3138,3,2,ARYA,"You're about to find out. Arya reaches for her sword. Before she can pick it up, Jaqen appears."
3139,3,2,JAQEN,What are you doing?
3140,3,2,WAIF,We were only playing. The game of faces.
3141,3,2,JAQEN,A girl is not ready.
3142,3,2,WAIF,Clearly not.
3143,3,2,ARYA,(Stands up). I am ready.
3144,3,2,JAQEN,For what? For whatever you want. To be a Faceless Man. To be no one. The waif turns to her. Jaqen looks at the sword on Arya’s bed.
3145,3,2,JAQEN,"Whose sword is that? It belongs to Arya Stark. Arya Stark's sword, Arya Stark's clothes, Arya Stark's stolen silver. A man wonders how is it that no one came to be surrounded by Arya Stark's things? The waif, looking smug, leaves. EXT. DOCK On a dock near the house of Black and White, Arya wraps a rock in her clothes. She is wearing new clothes, similar to the ones the waif wears. She ties them up and drops them into the water, the rock causing them to sink. She picks up her coin purse and throws it in the water. After a moment of examining her original coin in her hand, she throws it in the water as well. She looks at her sword Needle for a moment, and then picks it up. She prepares to throw it in the sea, but finds herself unable to, and begins to sob. She turns and walks over to some nearby rocks, and hides the sword under some of them. INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE Arya is again sweeping the floor in the main room. She notices the men from the beginning of the episode carrying another dead body into the back room. However, after a moment, she realizes that she didn’t hear the door close, and she looks up to find it wide open. Jaqen surprises her by suddenly putting his hand on her shoulder. He nods towards the door, and begins walking over to it. Arya follows him, leaving the broom outside. They go down a fire-lit tunnel. Jaqen opens the door at the end of the tunnel to reveal a chamber. Inside, the waif stands motionless next to a large stone slab. On it is the dead man. Jaqen leaves through the back door. After Jaqen closes the door, the waif begins to remove the dead man’s clothes. She looks up at Arya, who walks over and begins to do so as well. The waif inspects his body. She wets a rag and begins cleaning off the man."
3146,3,2,ARYA,"What do we do with them after we wash them? The waif only looks up and smiles lightly, making no other response. She goes back to washing him, and Arya wets a rag of her own to help."
3147,3,2,TO,WINTERFELL EXT. COURTYARD
3148,3,2,MAN,"Open gates! The gates are opened. Sansa, Baelish, and a number of knights on horseback gallop through. They stop. Theon watches from nearby through some metal bars, trembling. Baelish gets off of his horse. Roose, Ramsay, and Walda watch as Sansa gets off hers. Roose walks forward. Baelish leads Sansa towards him, rubbing her hands."
3149,3,2,ROOSE,"Lady Sansa, welcome. After a tense moment, Sansa smiles and curtsies."
3150,3,2,SANSA,(Smiles). Lord Bolton.
3151,3,2,ROOSE,"May I introduce my son, (Stands aside), Ramsay Bolton? Ramsay smiles and walks forwards, removing his gloves. Sansa smiles at him."
3152,3,2,RAMSAY,"It's an honor to meet you, my Lady. He takes her hand and kisses it. Nearby, Myranda and other women watch. INT. HALLWAY An old servant woman leads Sansa down a hallway to her chambers. She opens the door."
3153,3,2,WOMAN,I'll bring you a bowl of hot water. You must want to wash.
3154,3,2,SANSA,Thank you.
3155,3,2,WOMAN,"Welcome home, Lady Stark. (Quieter) The North remembers. Sansa watches as the woman leaves."
3156,3,2,TO,"CASTLE BLACK INT. DINING HALL Jon sits at a table, tapping his fingers anxiously. The men in the room talk amongst themselves."
3157,3,2,JON,Sam. (Sam looks up. Jon looks at Maester Aemon’s chair). Maester Aemon?
3158,3,2,SAM,He apologizes for not being here. He's not feeling well.
3159,3,2,JON,"Take good care of him. (To the group). Brothers. As you all know too well, it's long past time to dig a new latrine pit. (Laughter. Jon looks at Alliser). First Builder Yarwyck and I have decided to appoint a latrine captain to oversee this crucial task. (Laughter. After a moment, he continues). Brian. Seems like a good job for a ginger. Everyone laughs. Some of the men jokingly pat Brian on his back, and Brian laughs as well."
3160,3,2,JON,"Ser Alliser. (Silence). You have more experience than any other soldier at Castle Black. You proved your valour many times over, while defending the Wall from the wildling attack. I name you First Ranger. Some of the men shout in approval. Alliser looks up surprised. Edd and Sam look at each other. Janos pats him on the shoulder."
3161,3,2,JON,Lord Janos. I'm giving you command of Greyguard.
3162,3,2,JANOS,(Scoffs). Greyguard is a ruin.
3163,3,2,JON,"Yes, the fort is in a sorry state. Restore it as best you can. First Builder Yarwyck can spare ten of his -"
3164,3,2,JANOS,I was charged with the defense of King's Landing when you were soiling your swaddling clothes. Keep your ruin. Some of the men begin talking loudly. Olly shifts in his seat.
3165,3,2,SAM,"Alright, alright! Enough of that."
3166,3,2,JON,"You mistake me, my Lord. That was a command, not an offer. Pack your arms and armour, say your farewells, and ride for Greyguard."
3167,3,2,JANOS,"(Stands up, angrily shouts). I will not go meekly off to freeze and die! Give it to one of the fools who cast a stone for you. I will not have it. Do you hear me, boy? I will not have it!"
3168,3,2,JON,Are you refusing to obey my order? The men in the room all turn to look at Janos.
3169,3,2,JANOS,You can stick your order up your bastard arse. Some of the men whisper in shock. Janos looks pleased with himself. Alliser turns to Jon smugly.
3170,3,2,JON,Take Lord Janos outside. The men begin to stand up. Janos scoffs.
3171,3,2,JON,"Olly, bring me my sword. Olly turns quickly to Jon, then gets up. Janos looks more unsure of himself as more men get up. Alliser turns and looks at Janos disapprovingly. Edd walks over to get Janos. Alliser stands in his way for a moment. Jon looks at the confrontation, worried. Alliser raises his eyebrows for a moment and moves out of the way. Janos looks at him shocked. Edd grabs Janos, and some other men assist in dragging him outside."
3172,3,2,JANOS,"You cannot do this! Get your hands off me! (Everyone moves outside). Scum, all of you! If the boy thinks he can frighten me, he's mistaken, yes, very mistaken. Someone puts a chopping block down. Janos is taken up to it."
3173,3,2,JANOS,"A disgrace! I have friends, important friends in the capital! You'll see! Jon takes a final sip of his wine, gets up, and goes outside. The watchmen all gather in the courtyard. Olly hands Jon his sword. Jon walks up to where Janos is being held. Stannis watches from afar. Jon unsheathes his sword, and Janos looks up at it."
3174,3,2,JON,"If you have any last words, my Lord, now is the time."
3175,3,2,JANOS,"(Trembling). I was wrong. You're the Lord Commander! We all serve you. I'm sorry. Not only for this, for all I've done and said. I was wrong! (Jon brings his sword up). My Lord, please, mercy! Mercy! I'll go! I will! Please. I'm afraid. I've always been afraid. Janos sobs for a few moments. Jon hesitates, and then brings his sword down, decapitating Janos. He hands his sword to a watchman standing nearby. He looks up and makes eye contact with Stannis."
3176,3,2,TO,"KING’S LANDING INT. BROTHEL The High Septon kneels in the center of a room. Seven prostitutes, dressed as each of the new gods, circle around him. Olyvar stands behind the High Septon, wearing a fake beard and holding a scale. The prostitutes giggle as the High Septon eyes them all."
3177,3,2,OLYVAR,"You have served us well, my son."
3178,3,2,SEPTON,"Thank you, Father."
3179,3,2,OLYVAR,Which of the Seven will you worship today?
3180,3,2,SEPTON,The Maiden.
3181,3,2,OLYVAR,Where is the Maiden?
3182,3,2,SEPTON,And the Stranger.
3183,3,2,OLYVAR,"(Leaning forward). Two is extra, you realize?"
3184,3,2,SEPTON,"Yes, yes. Olyvar snaps his fingers. He and five of the prostitutes step aside. The two dressed as the Maiden and the Stranger remain and approach the High Septon, who smiles. Suddenly, some men led by Lancel Lannister barge into the room. The High Septon gasps and turns around."
3185,3,2,OLYVAR,"What are you doing? This establishment belong to Lord Petyr Baelish. You can't - The men force the High Septon to his feet. One of the men rips off Olyvar’s fake beard, hits him to the ground, and begins kicking him. The prostitutes run out of the room."
3186,3,2,LANCEL,You have profaned our faith. The faith of our fathers and forefathers.
3187,3,2,SEPTON,I am the High Septon of the -
3188,3,2,LANCEL,"(Grabs his neck). You are a sinner. And you shall be punished. The men drag the High Septon out of the room. He is forced out into the street naked, and begin walking. He tries to cover his penis with his hands, but one of the men hits him with a stick. People gather on the sides of the street to watch, and begin chanting."
3189,3,2,CROWD,Sinner! Sinner! Sinner! MAN 1: Repent!
3190,3,2,CROWD,Sinner! Sinner! Sinner! Sinner! Sinner! Sinner! MAN 2: Shame on you!
3191,3,2,CROWD,"Sinner! Sinner! INT. SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER Mace opens the door for the High Septon. He approaches the table. In better light, it is clear that his face is heavily bruised. Mace closes the door and walks over. The High Septon addresses each of the member present."
3192,3,2,SEPTON,"(To Cersei) Your Grace, (To Pycelle), Grandmaester, (To Mace) Lord Tyrell, (To Qyburn), uh…"
3193,3,2,QYBURN,It doesn't matter. (Mace sits down).
3194,3,2,SEPTON,"As the High Septon of the Faith of the Seven I give voice to the will of the Gods and am their foremost servant in this world. An insult to me is an insult to the Gods. An assault on my person, is an assault on our very religion."
3195,3,2,CERSEI,You were assaulted?
3196,3,2,SEPTON,"I was, by those fanatics who call themselves ‘sparrows’. They humiliated me, they they beat me, they left me naked and bleeding on the cobblestones. I am lucky to be alive."
3197,3,2,QYBURN,I heard this all began in Littlefinger's brothel.
3198,3,2,MACE,"High Septon, this is a rather shocking thing to hear."
3199,3,2,SEPTON,"I tend to both the highest born, and the lowliest amongst us. Even prostitutes may earn the mercy of the Mother."
3200,3,2,QYBURN,So you were administering to the needs of these devout prostitutes?
3201,3,2,PYCELLE,A man's private affairs ought to stay private!
3202,3,2,CERSEI,"What do you want from us, High Septon?"
3203,3,2,SEPTON,"Justice! I ask that you protect our Faith by arresting these criminals and throwing them in the black cells. I ask that you execute their leader, this so-called High Sparrow. He's a threat to everything we hold sacred. If he goes unpunished -"
3204,3,2,CERSEI,And where do I find this man? This High Sparrow? EXT. STREET A soldier helps Cersei out of her carriage. She begins walking forward. Ser Meryn stands ahead of her.
3205,3,2,MERYN,"I don't think this is a good idea, Your Grace."
3206,3,2,CERSEI,"Nonsense, Ser Meryn. These are deeply religious people. (To a man at the bottom of some stairs). Where can I find the High Sparrow? The man points up the stairs. They are crowded with people. Cersei and Ser Meryn ascend them. MAN 1: Seven blessings. Cersei covers her nose. At the top of the stairs is a large room. She watches as many people eat at tables. MAN 2: Thank you. MAN 3: Just a little more..."
3207,3,2,WOMAN,"Thank you ever so for the soup! In the center of the room, an old man is giving soup to people in line. Cersei approaches him."
3208,3,2,CERSEI,A young man said I would find the High Sparrow back here. Where is he?
3209,3,2,SPARROW,"High Sparrow? Sounds ridiculous, doesn't it? Like Lord Duckling, or King Turtle. (Laughs). So, it's meant to. We're often stuck with the names our enemies give to us. (Prepares soup for the next person in line). The notion that we are all equal in the eyes of Seven doesn't sit well with some, so they belittle me. WOMAN 2: Seven blessings to you."
3210,3,2,SPARROW,"Seven blessings to you, my dear. It's only a name, quite an easy burden to wear. Far easier than hers. (Prepares soup for the next person in line)."
3211,3,2,CERSEI,Why no shoes?
3212,3,2,SPARROW,Because I gave them away to someone who needed them more. We all do that. It stops us from forgetting what we really are.
3213,3,2,CERSEI,Is that why you came to King's Landing? To remind everyone?
3214,3,2,SPARROW,"Everyone? I have a hard enough job reminding myself. Oh, I tell them no one's special. And they think I'm special for telling them so."
3215,3,2,CERSEI,(Smiles). Perhaps they're right.
3216,3,2,SPARROW,"It would be comforting to believe that, wouldn't it? The Gods sent you here to tempt me? I hope not. I had assumed you'd only come here to arrest me. For that incident with the High Septon."
3217,3,2,CERSEI,"An unacceptable way to treat the chosen representative of the Gods in this world, wouldn't you say?"
3218,3,2,SPARROW,"Hypocrisy is a boil. Lancing a is never pleasant. Although, they could have been more careful with the blade."
3219,3,2,CERSEI,"The High Septon came to speak to me today. He doesn't want me to arrest you, he wants me to execute you."
3220,3,2,SPARROW,I wouldn't presume to know your thoughts on the matter.
3221,3,2,CERSEI,"(After a moment). My thoughts on the matter align with your own. The High Septon's behaviour was corrosive, as was his attitude. Having a man like that reside in the Sept eats away the Faith from the inside. So now he resides in the Red Keep's dungeons instead. (The High Sparrow looks up at her surprised). The Faith and the Crown are the two pillars that hold up this world. If one collapses, so does the other. We must do everything necessary to protect one another. INT. QYBURN’S LAB Qyburn pulls a rat out of a cage. He brings it over to a desk and holds a knife above it. The camera switches to his face, and blood splatters onto a protective lens. Cersei enters the room with a letter."
3222,3,2,QYBURN,Your Grace.
3223,3,2,CERSEI,"Send a raven with this message to Littlefinger in the Eyrie, or wherever he's slithering about. (Hands him the letter)."
3224,3,2,QYBURN,"At once, Your Grace. (Walks to his desk)."
3225,3,2,CERSEI,How's your work coming along?
3226,3,2,QYBURN,Very well.
3227,3,2,CERSEI,You've made progress?
3228,3,2,QYBURN,"More than I've expected. Still a way to go, but…"
3229,3,2,CERSEI,"Very good. I'll leave you to it then. Make sure Littlefinger is clear on the meaning of the word ""immediately"". Cersei leaves the room. Qyburn begins writing something down. Behind him on a table is a large object, covered by a sheet. After a few moments of writing, the object begins violently jerking around, and then stops."
3230,3,2,QYBURN,"Shh. Easy, friend."
3231,3,2,TO,"WINTERFELL COURTYARD Sansa walks through the busy courtyard. Theon is shoveling dirt nearby. He looks up to see her walking in his direction, and looks away, tense. On a platform above, Ramsay and Baelish stand, watching her."
3232,3,2,RAMSAY,She really is lovely. I hope I can make her happy.
3233,3,2,BAELISH,I hope so too. I've become quite fond of Lady Sansa during our travels together. She’s suffered enough.
3234,3,2,RAMSAY,I'll never hurt her. You have my word.
3235,3,2,BAELISH,"I've heard very little about you. Which makes you quite a rare thing, as lords go."
3236,3,2,RAMSAY,I haven't been a lord very long. I was a bastard.
3237,3,2,ROOSE,(Approaching). And you're not anymore. Allow me a moment alone with Lord Baelish.
3238,3,2,RAMSAY,"Yes, father. And thank you, Lord Baelish. I'm forever in your debt. (Bows)."
3239,3,2,BAELISH,He seems pleased.
3240,3,2,ROOSE,Shouldn't he be?
3241,3,2,BAELISH,"(They begin walking). I assure you she's still a virgin. Tyrion never consummated the marriage. By the law of the land, she's no man's wife. Inspect her, if you must."
3242,3,2,ROOSE,"I leave that to the brothel keeper. It's her name I need, not her virtue."
3243,3,2,BAELISH,Then I have delivered everything I've promised.
3244,3,2,ROOSE,And you prepared for the consequences. When the Lannisters hear I've wed Sansa Stark to Ramsay.
3245,3,2,BAELISH,"The Lannister name doesn't mean what it once did. Tywin is dead. He kept his house in power through sheer will. Without him, Jaime has one hand and no allies, Tommen is a soft boy, not a king to fear."
3246,3,2,ROOSE,The Queen will be enraged.
3247,3,2,BAELISH,"Queen Margaery adores Sansa. Cersei is Queen Mother, a title whose importance wanes with each passing day."
3248,3,2,ROOSE,"And yet she still has friends. Men in important places, whom she can ask for favours. (They stop, and Roose holds up a letter). A message for you, from Cersei Lannister. A rider arrived from Eyrie, shortly before dawn. Apparently, she thinks you're still in the Vale."
3249,3,2,BAELISH,"A message for me, you say. Strange that the seal is broken."
3250,3,2,ROOSE,"I'm sure you understand my position, Lord Baelish. If you received word in the night from the Queen Mother, it does make me question our new alliance. The Lannisters made you one of the great lords of Westeros. Yet, here you are in the North, undermining them. Why gamble with your position?"
3251,3,2,BAELISH,Every ambitious move is a gamble. You gambled when you drove a dagger into Robb Stark's heart. It appears that your gamble paid off. You're Warden of the North.
3252,3,2,ROOSE,I had Tywin Lannister backing. Who supports me now? You?
3253,3,2,BAELISH,"The Eyrie is mine. The last time the lords of the Eyrie formed an alliance with the lords of the North, they brought down the greatest dynasty this world has ever known. I'd like to borrow one of your birds. Cersei will expect a reply."
3254,3,2,ROOSE,I'd like to read the reply. Roose walks away.
3255,3,2,TO,VOLANTIS INT. VARYS AND TYRION’S CARRIAGE Tyrion repeatedly opens and closes a window.
3256,3,2,TYRION,I have to get out of this wheelhouse.
3257,3,2,VARYS,Volantis is a large city.
3258,3,2,TYRION,I have to get out of this wheelhouse.
3259,3,2,VARYS,The likelihood of you being spotted here increases a hundredfold.
3260,3,2,TYRION,"Mm, I have to get out of this wheelhouse."
3261,3,2,VARYS,I'm not sure how many new ways I can find of saying this.
3262,3,2,TYRION,(Walks over to him). I will not be of any use to Daenerys Targaryen if I lose my mind. I can't remember the last face I saw that wasn't yours.
3263,3,2,VARYS,It's a perfectly good face.
3264,3,2,TYRION,I'm losing my mind.
3265,3,2,VARYS,"If anyone recognizes you, you'll lose more than that."
3266,3,2,TYRION,"Look, we are thousands of miles from Westeros. (Pulls his hood up). What am I? (Varys shakes his head). One more drunk dwarf. Tyrion knocks on the front of the carriage. The camera then pans over part of the city. Varys and Tyrion walk through a busy marketplace."
3267,3,2,TYRION,Slaves.
3268,3,2,VARYS,Yes. The Volantene masters are very organized. (Shot of a man with a fly tattooed onto his cheek). Flies for dung shovelers. (Shot of a man with a hammer tattooed onto his cheek). Hammers for builders. (Shot of a man inspecting women with tears tattooed onto their cheeks). Tears for whores. Lest they forget. Varys and Tyrion arrive at a clearing in the market and stop. A woman speaks before a large crowd.
3269,3,2,PRIESTESS,(Valyrian) Lord cast your light upon us.
3270,3,2,CROWD,"(Valyrian, in unison) Lord cast your light upon us."
3271,3,2,PRIESTESS,(Valyrian) For the night is dark and full of terrors.
3272,3,2,VARYS,"(Aside) We should keep moving. Noticing Tyrion is no longer next to him, he frantically looks around."
3273,3,2,CROWD,"(Valyrian, in unison) For the night is dark and full of terrors."
3274,3,2,PRIESTESS,"(Valyrian) I was once as you are now. The woman points to her cheek. Tyrion watches from some nearby steps, and drinks some wine."
3275,3,2,PRIESTESS,"(Valyrian) Bought and sold, (Varys approaches Tyrion), scourged and branded..."
3276,3,2,TYRION,The only red priest we had in King's Landing was Thoros of Myr. This one's much better looking.
3277,3,2,PRIESTESS,(Valyrian) The Lord of Light hears your voice. He hears the king as he hears the slave; he hears the Stone Men in their misery...
3278,3,2,TYRION,Stone men. Good luck stopping this spread of grayscale with prayer. You'd have better luck dancing away the plague. (Varys shushes him worriedly).
3279,3,2,PRIESTESS,(Valyrian) He has sent you a saviour! From the fire she was reborn to remake the world! The Dragon Queen!
3280,3,2,TYRION,We're going to meet the Saviour! You should have told me. Who doesn't want to meet the Saviour? The priestess slowly turns her head to lock eyes with Tyrion.
3281,3,2,TYRION,"(Covering his face). Come on. Let's find a brothel. They return to the marketplace and continue walking. They stop at a large door, which a man is guarding. He rubs Tyrion’s head."
3282,3,2,MAN,(Valyrian) It’s good luck to rub a dwarf’s head.
3283,3,2,TYRION,"It's even better luck to suck a dwarf's cock. Varys rolls his eyes, exasperated. The man stares at him unamused. INT. BROTHEL"
3284,3,2,TYRION,"See? We blend right in. Just two more travellers, mad with lust. Elsewhere in the brothel, Jorah sets his cup down. Tyrion and Varys sit down at a table, and a woman comes to bring them wine."
3285,3,2,VARYS,Thank you. Tyrion clinks his glass against Varys’s. A prostitute dressed as Daenerys walks through the brothel. Tyrion looks at her.
3286,3,2,TYRION,Curious... hair. (She looks at him).
3287,3,2,MAN,(Across the room). The mother of dragons! He gestures for her to come over. She approaches their table.
3288,3,2,TYRION,"It appears you're not the only Targaryen supporter. Jorah watches the prostitute, and then looks away."
3289,3,2,VARYS,Someone who inspires priests and whores is worth taking seriously.
3290,3,2,MAN,What makes you worth that much?
3291,3,2,PROSTITUTE,I’m magic. (They laugh).
3292,3,2,MAN,"I bet you bloody are. Jorah listens to this, appearing extremely uncomfortable."
3293,3,2,TYRION,"Well, (Watches her kiss the man), she's taken. Tyrion spots another prostitute, with shorter dark hair. He gets up."
3294,3,2,VARYS,Where're you going?
3295,3,2,TYRION,I need to speak to someone with hair. Tyrion approaches the black haired prostitute.
3296,3,2,TYRION,Hello?
3297,3,2,PROSTITUTE,Hello.
3298,3,2,TYRION,You've got no drink.
3299,3,2,PROSTITUTE,You've got no money.
3300,3,2,TYRION,"Do I look like a man without money? (She looks at him incredulously). Never trust looks. Until quite recently, I was one of the richest men in the world. (She laughs). But who needs wealth when you can make a woman laugh? (Sits down). I always pay my debts, I'm well known for it. The blonde prostitute and the man giggle. Tyrion glances over at them."
3301,3,2,PROSTITUTE,You like her? They all like her. They all want to fuck a queen.
3302,3,2,TYRION,That’s because they’ve never met a queen.
3303,3,2,PROSTITUTE,You're just saying that.
3304,3,2,TYRION,"You know how to spot a liar. If I could pick any girl here, I would pick you."
3305,3,2,PROSTITUTE,Why?
3306,3,2,TYRION,Because you have a skeptical mind.
3307,3,2,PROSTITUTE,"(Smiles). Alright, then. I'm warning you. We’re gonna have to wash you first. She takes his hand, but Tyrion doesn’t get up."
3308,3,2,PROSTITUTE,Come on.
3309,3,2,TYRION,"(After a moment). I'm, I'm sorry, I can't."
3310,3,2,PROSTITUTE,Of course you can. You're shy.
3311,3,2,TYRION,I'm not.
3312,3,2,PROSTITUTE,Have another drink.
3313,3,2,TYRION,"Gladly, but this, I can't do. Believe me, no one is more shocked than I am. I hope it passes. What will I do in my spare time? I’ll go for a piss, that’s a start. She looks confused. Tyrion walks away. Varys, noticing that Tyrion is no longer in his view, gets up worriedly. INT./EXT. WINDOW Tyrion pisses out of a window, and sips his wine. He throws the cup out into the water below. He notices that someone is behind him."
3314,3,2,TYRION,"No need to worry, I was just - (Turns to see it’s not Varys, but Jorah). Oh, I thought you were someone else. Shows almost over. I'm sure the girls inside will be happy to oblige. Jorah looks behind him. As Tyrion pulls up his pants, Jorah puts a rope around him and begins tying it."
3315,3,2,TYRION,You made some kind of mistake. Why don't you tell me what you think you are doing and - Jorah puts a rag over Tyrion’s mouth.
3316,3,3,DEFAULT,"Sons of the Harpy Script Lyrics TITLE SEQUENCE EXT. BEACH A man hops out of his boat at night, and grabs a basket of fish. As he carries it on shore, Jorah knocks him out with a punch to the face. Looking around, he drags the man out of the water, and throws two coins on him. Jorah walks over to where he has Tyrion tied up. Tyrion is grunting, trying to cut the ropes binding him with a knife. Jorah picks up the knife and Tyrion. He throws Tyrion and his supplies into the boat, and then pushes it out to sea. Once it gains momentum, he hops in himself."
3317,3,3,TO,EXT. BOAT A number of men walk around doing various tasks on deck. Jaime Lannister looks out from the side of the boat. He turns to the captain.
3318,3,3,JAIME,Is that Estermont?
3319,3,3,CAPTAIN,"Tarth, Ser Jaime. (Shot of an island). The Sapphire Isle. INT. BELOW DECK A knife hits a sandbag."
3320,3,3,BRONN,Why are we on a merchant ship? Why no Lannister sails?
3321,3,3,JAIME,"This ship's sailing to Oldtown. We'll get off earlier, not far from Sunspear. Row ourselves to the Dornish shores in the night."
3322,3,3,BRONN,You ever been to Dorne?
3323,3,3,JAIME,No.
3324,3,3,BRONN,I have. The Dornish are crazy. All they want to do is fight and fuck. Fuck and fight.
3325,3,3,JAIME,You should be happy to go back. (Drinks some water).
3326,3,3,BRONN,"(Gets up, walking to his knife). There's nothing like a good fight to get you in the mood for fucking. (Pulls out his knife from the sandbag). And there's nothing like a fuck-mad Dornish girl to clear your head for the next fight. It's how the two work together. And we're gonna do a lot of fighting, I am sure. Well, I am. But I don't imagine we'll get to stick around for the rest. Not after we've kidnapped their princess."
3327,3,3,JAIME,"We are not kidnapping their princess. We are rescuing my niece, bringing her back to the family,"
3328,3,3,BRONN,"(Incredulously) Your niece? Jaime and Bronn have a stare-off. After a moment, Jaime looks away. Bronn drinks some water."
3329,3,3,BRONN,I've been doing this sort of thing a long time. I'm good at it. (Sits down).
3330,3,3,JAIME,That's why you're here.
3331,3,3,BRONN,"I know. Why are you here? Why not send 40 of me, or an army? Unlike most folks, you actually got one."
3332,3,3,JAIME,Because I don't want to start a war.
3333,3,3,BRONN,That still doesn't explain why you're doing it.
3334,3,3,JAIME,It has to be me.
3335,3,3,BRONN,"(Gets up starts walking). If I'm putting something of a lit together, a one-handed man, (Grabs some rope and walks back), who happens to be one of the most recognizable faces in Westeros, is not -"
3336,3,3,JAIME,It has to be me.
3337,3,3,BRONN,"(Sheaths his sword). You set your brother free, didn't you? I bet your sister didn't like that."
3338,3,3,JAIME,(Quietly) Varys set him free.
3339,3,3,BRONN,"Well, if you ever see the little fucker, (Lays down), give him my regards."
3340,3,3,JAIME,"He murdered my father. If I ever see him, I'll split him in two. And then I'll give him your regards."
3341,3,3,TO,"KING’S LANDING INT. SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER Cersei sits in her chair, looking angry. At the table is Maester Pycelle, Qyburn, Mace Tyrell, and an empty chair."
3342,3,3,MACE,The Iron Bank has called one tenth of the Crown's debts. Given the expense of rebuilding the royal -
3343,3,3,CERSEI,How much can the Crown afford?
3344,3,3,MACE,"With winter coming , half what they ask. Less."
3345,3,3,CERSEI,You're the Master of Coin. How do we pay them?
3346,3,3,MACE,"Well, House Tyrell could front the gold, and the the Crown will pay us back in time, or I'll have words with my daughter. Mace smiles, as if expecting a laugh. Qyburn and Pycelle both look down. Mace’s smile fades. Cersei smiles."
3347,3,3,CERSEI,"You've already given us too much. (Gets up and walks to a window). No, we must arrange better terms with the Iron Bank."
3348,3,3,MACE,Absolutely.
3349,3,3,CERSEI,In person.
3350,3,3,MACE,"(After a moment, looks at her surprised). Me? (Qyburn smiles)."
3351,3,3,CERSEI,"We must send an envoy to the Iron Bank, someone of importance, to show these bankers our respect. As the King's Master of Coin, I can think of no one more qualified."
3352,3,3,MACE,"I will be honored, Your Grace."
3353,3,3,CERSEI,"The King has expressed concern about his father-in-law's safety on this voyage. (Smiling). He's ordered Ser Meryn to personally lead your escort. Ser Meryn walks into the room. Mace turns to look at him, and then back at Cersei."
3354,3,3,MACE,My very own Kingsguard? Please express -
3355,3,3,CERSEI,"Safe travels, Lord Tyrell."
3356,3,3,MACE,"(Raises his hands). Of course, of course, (Gathers his belongings, and then gets up). I'll give your regards to the Titan of Braavos. Mace laughs. Qyburn looks down, lightly chuckling. Mace exits, followed by Ser Meryn."
3357,3,3,PYCELLE,The Small Council grows smaller and smaller.
3358,3,3,CERSEI,"(Walking out). Not small enough. Pycelle watches her leave. INT. HIGH SPARROW’S CHAMBER A note lies on the desk, stamped with the seal of the High Sparrow. The High Sparrow sits behind his desk, across from Cersei. She pours a glass of wine."
3359,3,3,CERSEI,"May I offer you some wine, Your Holiness?"
3360,3,3,SPARROW,"No. (Smiles). Cersei looks unsure, presumably having expected him to say yes. After a moment she smiles and pushes the wine away."
3361,3,3,CERSEI,The old High Septon would have asked the vintage. (Smiles).
3362,3,3,SPARROW,"I could say that our minds are temples to the Seven and should be kept pure. But the truth is, (Chuckles), I don't like the taste."
3363,3,3,CERSEI,Hmm.
3364,3,3,SPARROW,(After a moment). How may I serve?
3365,3,3,CERSEI,All over Westeros we hear about septs being burned. Silent sisters raped. Bodies of holy men piled in the streets.
3366,3,3,SPARROW,"Wars teach people to obey the sword, not the Gods."
3367,3,3,CERSEI,"Perhaps the Gods need a sword of their own. (HS raises an eyebrow). In the days before the Targaryens, the Faith Militant dispensed the justice of the Seven."
3368,3,3,SPARROW,"Well, the Faith Militant was disarmed more than two centuries ago."
3369,3,3,CERSEI,"If I explain the holy purpose to my son, the king, I have no doubt he will sign a decree arming the believers you felt worthy."
3370,3,3,SPARROW,An army that defends the bodies and souls of the common people.
3371,3,3,CERSEI,"An army and service to the Gods themselves. And to you, of course. As the chosen representative of the Seven."
3372,3,3,SPARROW,"An honor I never expected. Or indeed, ever wished for."
3373,3,3,CERSEI,"Which is why you were chosen. (HS smiles). You and I both know how the world works. Too often the wicked are the wealthiest, beyond the reach of justice. The king himself cannot always punish those who deserve it most."
3374,3,3,SPARROW,All sinners are equal before the Gods.
3375,3,3,CERSEI,(Smiles. Continues after a moment). What would you say if I told you we have a great sinner in our very midst? Shielded by gold and privilege.
3376,3,3,SPARROW,"May the Father judge him justly. (Smiles). EXT. STREET A group of Faith Militant, wearing black robes and chains, walk down the street. Many nearby people chatter amongst themselves and look on. They begin breaking open casks of wine, and people begin screaming. One throws some men out of a building. Wine from the broken casks flows down some steps. INT. A ROOM We see a man in pain, sweating heavily and biting down on a piece of cloth. Someone begins carving something on his forehead, and his hand scratches and grabs at the table. EXT. MARKETPLACE Outside, the Faith Militant destroy a marketplace, smashing things for sale, flipping over tables, and attacking merchants. One merchant, laying on the ground, looks up at some gold cloaks on a castle wall."
3377,3,3,MERCHANT,"Help me! Help me! The gold cloaks turn around, ignoring him. INT. A ROOM The man in the room continues to sweat and bite down on the cloth. His face trembles. The symbol continues being carved. INT. BROTHEL A prostitute moans while having sex with a client. Some Faith Militant walk in and interrupt. She shrieks as one grabs her by the hair and pulls her off of the man. Another comes in grinning and strikes the man with a stick. The prostitute is forced out of the room. Some more men interrupt an orgy. Two women start screaming. They begin beating some of the participants, and taking others out of the room. Olyvar attempts to confront a member of the Faith Militant as the man drags out a prostitute."
3378,3,3,OLYVAR,"(Angrily). This is Lord Petyr Baelish's establishment. The man elbows Olyvar in the face and continues on his way. After most of the Faith’s Militant are gone, Olyvar hears a scream. He walks towards the source of the scream, blood running from his noise, and hears another scream."
3379,3,3,MILITANT,"Cocksucker! (Man screams). Boy fucker! You barbaric filth! There's a special place in the Seventh Hell for your kind. Olyvar stands just outside the doorway of a large room. Inside, a group of militants, most of them armed, stand around a male prostitute and his male client. Both are naked and bloody on the floor."
3380,3,3,CLIENT,"Please, please, I'll pay! I'll pay all of you."
3381,3,3,MILITANT,"(Pulls out a knife). Yes, you will! Seize him. The client begins crying. Olyvar backs out of the doorway and begins running away. The client screams. INT. A ROOM Someone finishes carving the symbol on the man’s head. The carver walks away and the man, revealed to be Lancel Lannister, sits up, breathing heavily. The symbol on his forehead is the symbol of the Faith Militant. EXT. STAIRWELL A number of Faith’s Militant, all armed, walk down a stairwell. They enter a clearing, where Loras Tyrell is sparring with another man. Some people are spectating. The militants, including Lancel, approach the fight. Loras, having knocked the other man to the ground, removes his helmet. He hands his sword to another man, who hands Loras a drink. He suddenly becomes aware of the presence of the militants."
3382,3,3,MILITANT,Seize him. The militants grab Loras.
3383,3,3,LORAS,Get your hands off of me.
3384,3,3,LANCEL,"Ser Loras of House Tyrell, you have broken the laws of Gods and men."
3385,3,3,LORAS,Who do you think you are?
3386,3,3,LANCEL,"Justice. (Loras grunts and struggles). INT. HALLWAY Margaery walks down a hallway. She pushes a set of doors open, enters Tommen’s chambers, and angrily puts her hands on a table. Tommen is eating, and looks up at her, surprised."
3387,3,3,MARGAERY,Why is my brother in a cell?
3388,3,3,TOMMEN,"I, I don't know. I, I didn't order it."
3389,3,3,MARGAERY,We both know who did. (Walks away). You told me she was returning to Casterly Rock.
3390,3,3,TOMMEN,(Standing up). Are you saying my mother is behind this?
3391,3,3,MARGAERY,She's jealous you're not hers anymore. Arresting my brother is her revenge.
3392,3,3,TOMMEN,Aren't you and mother getting along?
3393,3,3,MARGAERY,"(Scoffs). Oh, my sweet, sweet King. (Sits down). Do you have any affection for me at all?"
3394,3,3,TOMMEN,(Takes her hand). Of course I do. You're my Queen.
3395,3,3,MARGAERY,I can't bear to think of my brother locked away in some grimy cell.
3396,3,3,TOMMEN,I'll set him free for you.
3397,3,3,MARGAERY,Do you promise? INT. CERSEI’S CHAMBERS Tommen walks into Cersei’s chambers. Cersei is staring out of a window and drinking wine.
3398,3,3,TOMMEN,I demand that Ser Loras be freed now!
3399,3,3,CERSEI,(Turns around). Did I arrest him?
3400,3,3,TOMMEN,"Well, no... But you armed the Faith Militant. You gave the High Sparrow an army."
3401,3,3,CERSEI,"I did. And your wife has every right to criticize. (Begins walking towards her desk). Can't allow fanatics to arrest the Queen's brother, no matter his perversions."
3402,3,3,TOMMEN,Then can I tell Margaery you'll have Ser Loras released?
3403,3,3,CERSEI,"I told you I am not holding Ser Loras. You're the King. I'm sure if you speak to the High Sparrow, he'll release the poor boy. EXT. THE GREAT SEPT A group of kingsguard lead Tommen to the Great Sept."
3404,3,3,KINGSGUARD,"Halt! The party stops. Tommen gets out and goes to the steps of the Sept on foot, followed by guards. A number of people are seen milling about around the base of the steps. Some Faith Militant stand guarding the steps. They block Tommen and his guards from walking up."
3405,3,3,MILITANT,His Holiness is praying. He will not be disturbed.
3406,3,3,KINGSGUARD,Give the order and we'll tear out this rebel.
3407,3,3,TOMMEN,"You mean, kill them? Here, in the sept?"
3408,3,3,KINGSGUARD,"You'll be sending them to meet the Gods that they love. The kingsguard and militants both adjust their stances, ready for a fight. A number of other people begin to watch. Some people begin yelling at Tommen. MAN 1: Bastard! MAN 2: You're an abomination! MAN 3: You're born of sin!"
3409,3,3,WOMAN,Filthy bastard!
3410,3,3,TOMMEN,"We'll find another way. Tommen begins walking away, followed by his guards. MAN 4: Abomination! INT. TOMMEN’S CHAMBERS Tommen opens the doors to his chambers, finding it empty."
3411,3,3,TOMMEN,My Queen? Margaery enters from outside.
3412,3,3,TOMMEN,There was no way to free Ser Loras without violence.
3413,3,3,MARGAERY,"You're the King of the Andals, the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, the Protector of the Realm. And you let a band of fanatics imprison your brother by law."
3414,3,3,TOMMEN,I'm going to speak to the High Sparrow.
3415,3,3,MARGAERY,Are you? When?
3416,3,3,TOMMEN,I--I don't know.
3417,3,3,MARGAERY,You don't know?
3418,3,3,TOMMEN,He was praying just now.
3419,3,3,MARGAERY,(Walking out). I have to send word to Grandmother.
3420,3,3,TOMMEN,Will you come back later? (Margaery stops).
3421,3,3,MARGAERY,"I need to be with my family, Your Grace. (Continues walking)."
3422,3,3,TOMMEN,Of course.
3423,3,3,TO,THE WALL EXT. CASTLE BLACK Some Night’s Watchmen spar in the courtyard. A number of others look on. Stannis and Selyse watch from some stairs.
3424,3,3,SELYSE,You think highly of this boy.
3425,3,3,JON,(To some of the men sparring). Good.
3426,3,3,STANNIS,Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.
3427,3,3,SELYSE,A bastard by some tavern slut.
3428,3,3,STANNIS,"Perhaps, but that wasn't Ned Stark's way."
3429,3,3,SELYSE,I should have given you a son.
3430,3,3,STANNIS,Not your fault.
3431,3,3,SELYSE,Whose then? (Looks at their daughter Shireen). I gave you nothing but weakness. (Turns back). And deformity. (Stannis shakes his head).
3432,3,3,MELISANDRE,(Walking towards them). Those scars mean nothing to the Lord of Light.
3433,3,3,SELYSE,My Lady.
3434,3,3,MELISANDRE,"Her father is the Lord's chosen King. And her father's blood runs through her veins. Melisandre and Selyse stare at each other. After a moment, Selyse walks away."
3435,3,3,MELISANDRE,You march on Winterfell soon?
3436,3,3,STANNIS,We must. To beat the snows.
3437,3,3,MELISANDRE,Once before you put your faith in Ser Davos and left me behind. I hope you won't make that mistake again.
3438,3,3,STANNIS,I won't. I need you.
3439,3,3,MELISANDRE,"You only need faith, my King."
3440,3,3,STANNIS,"(Walking away). And you, my Lady, what do you need?"
3441,3,3,MELISANDRE,"To serve my Lord. Stannis turns back. They both watch Jon sparring. INT. JON’S CHAMBER Jon sits at his desk. Sam hands him various letters to sign, one by one."
3442,3,3,SAM,Lord Ashford. (Jon signs). Lady Coalfield. (Jon signs). Lord Smallwood.
3443,3,3,JON,Never even heard of these people.
3444,3,3,SAM,They haven't heard of you either. (Jon signs). But we need men and they have some.
3445,3,3,JON,And how many men does this Lord Maison have to send us?
3446,3,3,SAM,"(Chuckles, looking at the next letter). More than Lord Weebly. Sam’s face grows dark after reading the next letter. When Jon finishes signing the letter to Lord Weebly, Sam hands it to him, saying nothing. Jon begins signing, but hesitates."
3447,3,3,JON,Not him.
3448,3,3,SAM,"I know, I'm sorry, but we need men and supplies. And Roose Bolton is the Warden of The North."
3449,3,3,JON,He murdered my brother.
3450,3,3,SAM,"We swore to be the Watchers on the Wall. We can't watch the Wall with 50 men. And we can't get more men without help from the Warden of the North. Jon hesitates another moment, and then relents and signs the letter. He leans his chair back, and Sam gathers up all of the signed letters. He walks away, almost bumping into Melisandre as she enters Jon’s chambers."
3451,3,3,SAM,"Apologies, my Lady. Sam and Melisandre both look at Jon. Jon nods at Sam, and he leaves. Melisandre closes the door behind him, and Jon straightens up his posture."
3452,3,3,MELISANDRE,Lord Commander.
3453,3,3,JON,How can I help you?
3454,3,3,MELISANDRE,"Come with us when we ride south. (Walks forwards). None of us know the castle as well as you do. Its hidden tunnels, its weaknesses, its people. Winterfell was your home once. Don't you want to chase the rats out of it? (Turns to Jon)."
3455,3,3,JON,Castle Black is my home now. Night's Watch takes no part in the wars of the Seven Kingdoms.
3456,3,3,MELISANDRE,There's only one war. Life against death. Come. Let me show what you're fighting for. (Walks in front of Jon).
3457,3,3,JON,"You're gonna show me some vision in the fire. Forgive me, my Lady. But I don't trust in visions."
3458,3,3,MELISANDRE,"No visions. No magic. Just life. She opens up her robes, naked underneath. She leans back, and takes Jon’s hand, slowly leading it up her body to cup her breast."
3459,3,3,MELISANDRE,"Do you feel my heart beating? This power in you, you resist it, and that's your mistake. Embrace it. Melisandre smiles and looks down at Jon’s hand. Jon looks too. Realizing that she is no longer holding it there, he quickly pulls it away. Melisandre caresses Jon’s face and sits on his lap."
3460,3,3,MELISANDRE,"The Lord of Light made us male and female. Two parts of a greater whole. We are joining this power. Power to make life, power to make light, and power to cast shadows."
3461,3,3,JON,I don't think Stannis would like that very much.
3462,3,3,MELISANDRE,Then we shouldn't tell him. (Starts unbuttoning Jon’s coat).
3463,3,3,JON,I can't.
3464,3,3,MELISANDRE,Why?
3465,3,3,JON,I swore a vow. (Melisandre looks at him incredulously). I loved another.
3466,3,3,MELISANDRE,"The dead don't need lovers. Only the living. Jon keeps her from unbuttoning his coat any further, breathing heavily."
3467,3,3,JON,"I know. But I still love her. Melisandre stands up, closes her robes, and walks away. After opening the door to leave, she turns to Jon."
3468,3,3,MELISANDRE,"You know nothing, Jon Snow. Jon’s mouth opens a bit. She smirks and leaves. INT. STANNIS’S ROOM Stannis sits at his desk, reading something. There’s a knock at the door. After a moment, Shireen enters. Stannis looks up at her and then back down at his reading material. She closes the door. She smiles, but after Stannis doesn’t return her smile, she walks over to a nearby dresser and begins playing with the objects on top of it."
3469,3,3,STANNIS,Are you lonely?
3470,3,3,SHIREEN,"(Turns around, holding something). Just bored."
3471,3,3,STANNIS,My father used to tell me that boredom indicates a lack of inner resources.
3472,3,3,SHIREEN,"(Looks up). Were you bored a lot, too?"
3473,3,3,STANNIS,"I know Castle Black is no place for a child, but I -"
3474,3,3,SHIREEN,I like it. (Walks to a table). I thought I'd be left at home. I know mother didn't want to bring me. (Picks up an X from the table) .
3475,3,3,STANNIS,Why do you say that?
3476,3,3,SHIREEN,"She told me, ""I don't want to bring you."" Shireen fiddles with the objects in her hands. Stannis looks down."
3477,3,3,STANNIS,"She shouldn't have said that. Shireen puts down the objects she was playing with, and turns to leave. Before opening the door, she turns back to Stannis."
3478,3,3,SHIREEN,"Are you ashamed of me, father? Stannis looks up surprised. He puts down what he was doing. Shireen looks down."
3479,3,3,STANNIS,"When you were an infant, (Stands up and walks around his desk), the Dornish trailer landed on Dragonstone. His goods were junk except for one wooden doll. He'd even sewn a dress on it in the colors of our House. No doubt he'd heard of your birth, and assumed new fathers were easy targets. I still remember how you smiled when I put that doll in your cradle, (Shireen smiles), and you pressed it to your cheek. (Looks down. Shireen’s smile drops). By the time we burnt the doll, it was too late. (Walks to the table and adjusts the objects on it). I was told you would die. Or worse, the grayscale would go slow. (Turns to her). Let you grow just enough to know the world before taking it away from you. Everyone advised me to send you to the ruins of Valyria to live out your short life with the Stone men, before the sickness spread to the castle. I told them all to go to hell. (Shireen smiles). I called in every maester on this side of the world. Every healer, every apothecary. They stopped the disease and saved your life. Because you did not belong across the world with the bloody Stone men. (Walks towards her). You are the Princess Shireen of House Baratheon. And you are my daughter. After a moment, Shireen hugs Stannis. At first hesitant, he hugs her back."
3480,3,3,TO,"WINTERFELL INT. TOMBS UNDERNEATH WINTERFELL Sansa lights a candle on a tomb. She then walks over to Lyanna’s tomb and places a candle in the hand of Lyanna’s statue. She then leans down to pick a dusty feather off of the ground. As she blows off the dust, a figure is seen approaching in the background."
3481,3,3,BAELISH,I thought I might find you here. (Sansa turns to him). Your Aunt Lyanna.
3482,3,3,SANSA,"Father never talked about her. Sometimes I'd find him down here, lighting the candles. They say she was beautiful."
3483,3,3,BAELISH,"I saw her once. I was a boy, living with your mother's family. Lord Whent had a great tourney at Harrenhal. Everyone was there. The Mad King, your father, Robert Baratheon. And Lyanna, she was already promised to Robert. You can imagine what it was like for me, a boy from nowhere, with nothing to his name, watching these legendary men, tilting at the lists. The last two riders were Barristan Selmy and Rhaegar Targaryen. When Rhaegar won, everyone cheered for the prince. I remember the girls laughing when he took off his helmet and they saw that silver hair. How handsome he was. Until he rode right past his wife, Elia Martell, and all the smiles died. I've never seen so many people so quiet. He rode past his wife, and he lay a crown of winter roses in Lyanna's lap. Blue as frost. How many tens of thousands had to die because Rhaegar chose your aunt?"
3484,3,3,SANSA,"Yes, he chose her… and then he kidnapped her and raped her."
3485,3,3,BAELISH,Come. (Takes her arm). Let's speak somewhere the dead can't hear us. (They begin walking away).
3486,3,3,SANSA,Dressed for riding?
3487,3,3,BAELISH,I am.
3488,3,3,SANSA,Where are you going?
3489,3,3,BAELISH,King's Landing.
3490,3,3,SANSA,King's Landing?
3491,3,3,BAELISH,Cersei sent for me. (They stop). We must not let her sniff out any trouble.
3492,3,3,SANSA,You can't leave me here!
3493,3,3,BAELISH,"I know how hard it is to live with people you despise, believe me. But it won't be for long."
3494,3,3,SANSA,How do you know?
3495,3,3,BAELISH,"(They begin walking again). Stannis Baratheon garrisons at Castle Black. He'll march south to King's Landing before the winter snows block his way. But first, he has to take Winterfell."
3496,3,3,SANSA,You don't know that.
3497,3,3,BAELISH,"I do. Once he liberates these lands from the Boltons he'll rally your father's bannermen to his cause. With the North behind him, Stannis can finally take the Iron Throne."
3498,3,3,SANSA,You think he'll defeat the Boltons?
3499,3,3,BAELISH,"He has a larger army. He's the finest military commander in Westeros. A betting man would put his money on Stannis. (They stop). As it happens, I am a betting man."
3500,3,3,SANSA,And if you're right?
3501,3,3,BAELISH,"Stannis takes Winterfell, he rescues you from the most despised family in the North. Grateful for your late father's courageous support for his claim, he names you Wardeness of the North."
3502,3,3,SANSA,"But I, I wouldn't… Wardeness of the North"
3503,3,3,BAELISH,You are the last surviving Stark. He needs you.
3504,3,3,SANSA,"What if you're wrong? What if Stannis never attacks Winterfell, or he does and the Boltons defeat him?"
3505,3,3,BAELISH,"Then you will take this Bolton boy, Ramsay, and make him yours."
3506,3,3,SANSA,I don't know how to do that.
3507,3,3,BAELISH,Of course you do. He's already fallen for you.
3508,3,3,SANSA,His father frightens me.
3509,3,3,BAELISH,"He should, he's a dangerous man. But even the most dangerous men can be outmaneuvered. And you’ve learnt to maneuver from the very best. (Puts a hand on her shoulder). I return before too long. (Puts a hand behind her head). You'll be strong without me. (She nods, and he kisses her). The North will be yours. Do you believe me?"
3510,3,3,SANSA,I expect I'll be a married woman by the time you return. Baelish chuckles and pats her shoulder. He turns and leaves as Sansa watches him.
3511,3,3,TO,"DORNE EXT. BOAT At night, Bronn and Jaime sit in a boat. Bronn rows to shore alone. Looking across at Jaime, Jaime holds up his fake hand. Bronn begrudgingly goes back to rowing alone. After they get to shore, they carry their boat in, and hide it in some tall grass. They then both walk away. EXT. DESERT - THE NEXT MORNING Jaime awakens to find Bronn standing over him with a knife. His eyes widens and he moves to the side as Bronn brings his knife down on a snake that was about to bite Jaime. Jaime looks at the snake and Bronn pulls his knife out of it."
3512,3,3,BRONN,Breakfast. Bronn and Jaime sit at a fire. Bronn cooks the snake while Jaime puts gloves on.
3513,3,3,BRONN,That would have been a shit way to die.
3514,3,3,JAIME,"As far as I've seen, they're all shit ways to die."
3515,3,3,BRONN,Aye. But your lot like to give the singers a good ending.
3516,3,3,JAIME,I don't care what's sung about me when I'm dead.
3517,3,3,BRONN,"No? Two knights, off to rescue a princess. Sounds like a good song to me."
3518,3,3,JAIME,"Sounds like all the rest. While Bronn is distracted eating, Jaime gets rid of his food."
3519,3,3,JAIME,What about you? What shit way would you choose?
3520,3,3,BRONN,"In my own keep, drinking my own wine, watching my sons grovel for my fortune."
3521,3,3,JAIME,How disappointing. I thought you'd have something more exciting planned.
3522,3,3,BRONN,I've had an exciting life. I want my death to be boring. How do you want to go?
3523,3,3,JAIME,In the arms of the woman I love.
3524,3,3,BRONN,She want the same thing?
3525,3,3,JAIME,Let's go. They both get up and gather their things. Bronn stomps out the fire. The scene cuts to them walking through some tall grass later.
3526,3,3,BRONN,"The captain to that ship… What was he, Braavosi?"
3527,3,3,JAIME,Pentoshi.
3528,3,3,BRONN,And he's headed to Oldtown?
3529,3,3,JAIME,As I said. Why?
3530,3,3,BRONN,What's to stop him from docking down the coast and telling the locals that Jaime Lannister's in Dorne?
3531,3,3,JAIME,A bag of gold.
3532,3,3,BRONN,I'm not sure you understand how much people hate your family in this part of the world.
3533,3,3,JAIME,It was a heavy bag.
3534,3,3,BRONN,And I bet he swore all kinds of oaths to get it. But you won't be around if he breaks them. A horse neighs in the distance. Jaime looks around. A group of Dornish riders approach. Bronn and Jaime hide in the grass. Jaime watches the riders.
3535,3,3,BRONN,How many you count?
3536,3,3,JAIME,Four.
3537,3,3,BRONN,How many you think you can take?
3538,3,3,JAIME,"One, if he's slow. Bronn turns to look at the riders."
3539,3,3,RIDER,"Halt! The rider holds up his hand, and the party stops, having spotted Jaime and Bronn’s footsteps."
3540,3,3,BRONN,"Fucked in the arse. (Both get up). Hiya! (The riders approach them). Morning, lads. Glad we found you."
3541,3,3,RIDER,Who are you?
3542,3,3,BRONN,Cooper. (Points to Jaime). This is Darnell.
3543,3,3,RIDER,You're from King's Landing.
3544,3,3,BRONN,Accent gave me away? Flea Bottom. Whelped and whipped.
3545,3,3,RIDER,Why are you here?
3546,3,3,BRONN,"Our ship capsized in the night. We managed to swim ashore. It was a near thing, really."
3547,3,3,JAIME,I thought the sharks would get us. (Bronn looks at him).
3548,3,3,RIDER,There are no sharks in Dorne.
3549,3,3,JAIME,I could have sworn those were shark fins.
3550,3,3,BRONN,Dolphins maybe.
3551,3,3,RIDER,Throw your swords in the sand.
3552,3,3,BRONN,"Boys, there's no need for this. Just, point us in the right direction. We'll find our way home."
3553,3,3,RIDER,"Swords in the sand! Now! Bronn and Jaime look at each other. They pull out their swords. Bronn puts his down in the sand, and then flings a knife into the throat of a rider. He then kills another, stabbing him and knocking him off of his horse. A third charges him, and Bronn knocks him off of his horse as well. However, he survives. Bronn turns to Jaime."
3554,3,3,BRONN,"That one should be slow enough. Bronn approaches the fourth and final rider. Jaime turns to the injured rider, who is revealed to be much larger than Jaime. They begin fighting. In the background, Bronn knocks the fourth rider off of his horse. As Jaime and the man fight, Jaime is slowly pushed back, down a hill. He falls over and begins rolling to escape his attacker. He loses his balance and his sword is knocked away. As the attacker brings his sword down to kill Jaime, Jaime brings his gold hand up to block it. The sword gets stuck in Jaime’s hand. As the attacker is stuck trying to remove the sword, Jaime picks his back up, kills him, and kicks him down the hill."
3555,3,3,BRONN,Nice move! (Jaime turns to him).
3556,3,3,JAIME,Luck.
3557,3,3,BRONN,"You had a wonderful teacher. Bronn turns and walks away. Jaime looks back down the hill, and then to his hand. Failing to shake the sword off, he is forced to dislodge it by kicking it out of his own hand. Bronn is then seen cleaning his sword off on the clothes of one of the dead riders. He sheaths his sword as Jaime approaches."
3558,3,3,BRONN,Always wanted a Dornish stallion. Beasts can run a day and night without tiring. We'll ride to the Water Gardens with a nice breeze in our face.
3559,3,3,JAIME,First we need to bury these bodies.
3560,3,3,BRONN,Birds have to eat too.
3561,3,3,JAIME,"Corpses raise questions, questions raise armies. We're not here to start a war."
3562,3,3,BRONN,Do you know how long it will take us to dig all those holes?
3563,3,3,JAIME,"(Holding out his hand). I can't dig very well with one hand. Not at all, really. Jaime walks away as Bronn’s face drops. He begins dragging a body. EXT. BEACH Elaria, in all black, swiftly rides down a beach on horseback. She approaches a tent. Nearby are some more horses, and in the tent are Nymeria, Obara, and Tyene. Tyene exits the tent to meet her as she dismounts."
3564,3,3,TYENE,Nama! Tyene and Elaria embrace.
3565,3,3,ELARIA,"Nym, Obara."
3566,3,3,OBARA,Will it be war?
3567,3,3,ELARIA,"Prince Doran will weep for your father, but nothing else. We must avenge Oberyn ourselves."
3568,3,3,OBARA,Without Doran we have no army to march against the Lannisters.
3569,3,3,ELARIA,"We don't need an army to start a war. (Drinks water). Queen Cersei loves her children, and we have one of them."
3570,3,3,NYMERIA,"We may have a problem. Nymeria uses a whip to knock a bucket away. Underneath is the captain who brought Jaime and Bronn to Dorne, buried neck-deep in sand and covered in scorpions."
3571,3,3,OBARA,"A ship's captain, who found me in Planky Town, claiming he had information to sell. He told me he smuggled Jaime Lannister into Dorne."
3572,3,3,ELARIA,"He's come for Myrcella. If he gets to her before we do, we lose our only chance for revenge. You must choose. Doran's way and peace, or my way and war."
3573,3,3,TYENE,(Walks towards her). I'm with you. Always. (Elaria puts a hand to her face).
3574,3,3,ELARIA,Nym? (Nymeria nods). Obara?
3575,3,3,OBARA,"When I was a child, (Begins walking), Oberyn came to take me to court. I'd never seen this man, and yet he called himself my father. My mother wept, said I was too young, and a girl. Oberyn tossed his spear at my feet and said, ""Girl or boy, we fight our battles. But the Gods let us choose our weapons."" My father pointed to the spear, and then to my mother's tears. Obara picks up a spear that was sticking out of the sand. She twirls it around for a moment, and then tosses it through the captain’s head, killing him."
3576,3,3,OBARA,(Smiles). I made my choice long ago. Elaria and Tyene smile.
3577,3,3,TO,"EXT. BOAT AT SEA Jorah steers the boat as Tyrion, tied up and gagged, tries to speak. He only succeeds in mumbling. Eventually he stops trying to say real words, and instead only tries to be as loud as possible, to annoy Jorah. Jorah comes over and ungags him, and then walks back over to continue steering."
3578,3,3,TYRION,Thank you. (After a long pause). Who are you?
3579,3,3,JORAH,Your captor.
3580,3,3,TYRION,Do you have wine?
3581,3,3,JORAH,No.
3582,3,3,TYRION,I can't sleep without wine.
3583,3,3,JORAH,Then stay awake.
3584,3,3,TYRION,You're going the wrong way. My sister's in Westeros. Westeros is west! We're heading east.
3585,3,3,JORAH,I'm not taking you to your sister.
3586,3,3,TYRION,You said you were taking me to the Queen.
3587,3,3,JORAH,I am. Queen Daenerys Targaryen. She's the Queen I serve.
3588,3,3,TYRION,(Chuckles). What a waste of a good kidnapping. So happens I was heading there myself!
3589,3,3,JORAH,What business would you have with the Queen?
3590,3,3,TYRION,"Gold and glory. Oh, and hate. If you've ever met my sister, you'd understand. So now that it's clear we're on the same side? (Holds out his hands expectantly. Jorah makes no move to respond). A high born knight from the North of Westeros, down on his luck in Essos. Dragon epaulettes? Bear sigil breast plate. You're Jorah Mormont. I have to ask how, exactly, were you serving your Queen in a whore house, half a world away? Is it possible, that you were running? Why would you be running? And why would she have sent you away? Oh, wait! You were spying on her, weren't you? It's all coming back to me! I was drunk through most of the Small Council meetings, but it's all coming back. You passed notes to Varys's little birds. She found out, didn't she? Found out, and exiled you. (Jorah looks downtrodden). And now you hope to win back her favor with a gift. A risky scheme. One might even say, desperate. Do you think Daenerys would execute me, and pardon you? I'd say the reverse is just as likely. Jorah stops steering and approaches Tyrion. Tyrion holds out his hands again, but Jorah strikes him, knocking him unconscious. He then goes back to steering, looking worried."
3591,3,3,TO,YUNKAI EXT. BALCONY OVERLOOKING THE CITY Daenerys and Ser Barristan stand on the balcony.
3592,3,3,DAENERYS,Everyone looks happy enough from up here. (Barristan chuckles). What?
3593,3,3,BARRISTAN,"I was thinking of all the times your brother made me go with him down from the Red Keep, into the streets of King's Landing."
3594,3,3,DAENERYS,Why?
3595,3,3,BARRISTAN,"He liked to walk among the people, he liked to sing to them."
3596,3,3,DAENERYS,He sang to them?
3597,3,3,BARRISTAN,Yes. Rhaegar would take a spot on the Hook or the Street of Seeds and then he'd sing. Just like all the other minstrels.
3598,3,3,DAENERYS,And what did you do?
3599,3,3,BARRISTAN,I made sure no one killed him. And I collected the money. (Daenerys looks surprised). Well he liked to see how much he could make.
3600,3,3,DAENERYS,He was good?
3601,3,3,BARRISTAN,He was very good. Viserys never told you?
3602,3,3,DAENERYS,He told me Rhaegar was good at killing people. (Sits down).
3603,3,3,BARRISTAN,Rhaegar never liked killing. He loved singing.
3604,3,3,DAENERYS,And what did you do with the money?
3605,3,3,BARRISTAN,"Well, one time, he gave it to the next minstrel down the street. One time, he gave it to an orphanage in Flea Bottom. One time... we got horribly drunk. (They both laugh)."
3606,3,3,DARIO,"(Entering). Your Grace. Hizdahr is here, waiting in your audience chamber."
3607,3,3,DAENERYS,How many others are there?
3608,3,3,DARIO,Fifty a hundred.
3609,3,3,DAENERYS,"Will you be joining us, Ser Barristan?"
3610,3,3,DARIO,I think I can protect you from Hizdahr Zo Loraq.
3611,3,3,DAENERYS,"I think I can protect me from Hizdahr Zo Loraq. Go, Ser Barristan. Sing a song for me."
3612,3,3,BARRISTAN,Your Grace. (Leaves). INT. AUDIENCE CHAMBER
3613,3,3,HIZDAHR,All men must die. But not all can die in glory.
3614,3,3,MISSANDEI,Glory?
3615,3,3,HIZDAHR,"Why else do men fight? Why did your ancestors cross the Narrow Sea and conquer the Seven Kingdoms? So their names would live on. Those who find victory in the fighting pits, will never become kings, but their names will live on. It's the best chance they'll ever have."
3616,3,3,DAENERYS,Is that what you used to tell men before you set them to butchering each other for sport?
3617,3,3,HIZDAHR,"Your Grace, today is the traditional start of the fighting season."
3618,3,3,DAENERYS,I do not recognize this tradition.
3619,3,3,HIZDAHR,"Traditions are the only thing that will hold this city, your city, together. (Shots of Sons of the Harpy walking through tunnels with torches). Without them, former slaves and former masters have nothing in common. Nothing but centuries of mistrust and resentment. I can't promise this is the answer to all our problems, but it's a start. EXT. MARKETPLACE A prostitute and a soldier laugh with each other. Another soldier talks with some women. Some Sons of the Harpy kill all of the soldiers in the area, causing panic. In a nearby alley, some Unsullied march. Hearing the chaos, they begin running towards the market. They find the prostitute crying over the body of the dead soldier."
3620,3,4,DEFAULT,"Kill the Boy Script Lyrics TITLE SEQUENCE INT. ROOM Grey Worm lays in a bed, asleep. Missandei stands over him, crying. INT. THRONE ROOM The room is dark, except for some candles. Daenerys and Daario stand over the body of Barristan. Hizdahr enters with two men."
3621,3,4,HIZDAHR,"I am so sorry, my queen. He was a good man."
3622,3,4,DAENERYS,"""Barristan the Bold"" they called him. He crossed a continent to serve me . He was a loyal friend. And he died in an alley, butchered by cowards who hide behind masks ."
3623,3,4,DAARIO,"We could pull back to the pyramid district , secure it, and use it as a base from which to operate. Then we clean the city out, neighborhood by neighborhood, street by street, until the rats have nowhere left to hide. Daario walks over the Daenerys and looks at Hizdahr. He looks back. Daenerys turns around."
3624,3,4,DAENERYS,I prefer your earlier suggestion. Round up the leaders of each of Meereen's great families and bring them to me.
3625,3,4,HIZDAHR,But... I'm the leader of my family. Daario nods. The two men behind Hizdahr grab and restrain him. He is taken away.
3626,3,4,HIZDAHR,"No, Your Grace! I had nothing to do with this. Your Grace! INT. DRAGON CHAMBER Daenerys, Daario, some Unsullied, and a number of men stand in the chamber. Daario holds a torch. After a few moments, Daenerys turns around and begins walking. Daario follows her. Then a chain can be heard rattling. Daenerys and Daario turn around."
3627,3,4,DAENERYS,( in Valyrian ) Walk forward. The Unsullied lower their spears at the other men.
3628,3,4,MAN,"(Valyrian) You cannot do this. The Unsullied begin walking forward, forcing the men to move. After a few moments, they stop. Chains rattle again."
3629,3,4,DAENERYS,(Valyrian) Another step. The Unsullied and the men take another step. Chains rattle and an unseen dragon snarls. Daenerys walks through the Unsullied to the front of the group.
3630,3,4,DAENERYS,"(Valyrian) They will eat you, if I tell them to. They may eat you even if I don’t. Children. Some say I should give up on them. (One of the men is mumbling). But a good mother never gives up on her children. She disciplines them if she must. Daenerys looks at Daario. He walks over and pushes the mumbling man forward, onto his knees."
3631,3,4,DAENERYS,"(Valyrian) But she does not give up on them. The man’s eyes widen. A dragon comes out of the shadows and breathes fire on him. He screams and dies. The dragons take his corpse, tear it in two, and eat it."
3632,3,4,DAENERYS,"(Valyrian) Who is innocent? Maybe all of you are, (Looks at Hizdahr), maybe none of you are. Maybe, (Touching Hizdahr’s arm), I should let the dragons decide."
3633,3,4,HIZDAHR,"(Valyrian) All men must die. The other men besides Hizdahr grovel before Daenerys. The dragons continue eating. After a moment, she takes her hand off of Hizdahr."
3634,3,4,DAENERYS,"Don't want to overfeed them. Tomorrow perhaps. Daario and the Unsullied take the men out. Daenerys watches her dragons eat for a moment, and then walks out herself."
3635,3,4,TO,"CASTLE BLACK INT. LIBRARY Sam sits at a table, reading a letter. Aemon is with him."
3636,3,4,SAM,"""And though Daenerys maintains her grip on Slaver's Bay, forces rise against her from within and without. She refuses to leave until the freedom of the former slaves is secure."" She sounds like quite a woman."
3637,3,4,AEMON,"And she's alone, under siege, no family to guide her or protect her. Her last relation thousands of miles away, useless, dying."
3638,3,4,SAM,"Don't say that, Maester Aemon."
3639,3,4,AEMON,"A Targaryen, alone in the world, is a terrible thing. Jon walks in."
3640,3,4,JON,Maester Aemon.
3641,3,4,AEMON,Lord Commander.
3642,3,4,JON,"Sam, I'd like to speak to the maester alone. Sam gets up, grabs his papers, and leaves. Jon walks over and sits at the table."
3643,3,4,JON,How are you feeling?
3644,3,4,AEMON,"Oh, like a hundred-year-old man slowly freezing to death."
3645,3,4,JON,"I need your advice. There's something I want to do, something I have to do. But it'll divide the Night's Watch. Bitterly. Half the men will hate me the moment I give the order."
3646,3,4,AEMON,"Half the men hate you already, Lord Commander. Do it."
3647,3,4,JON,But you don't know what it is.
3648,3,4,AEMON,"That doesn't matter. You do. You will find little joy in your command. But with luck, you will find the strength to do what needs to be done. Kill the boy, Jon Snow. Winter is almost upon us. Kill the boy, and let the man be born. INT. ROOM Jon and Tormund sit across from each other at a table."
3649,3,4,JON,Where are the rest of the free folk now? (Tormund scoffs). Where have they gone? (No response). Who leads them?
3650,3,4,TORMUND,They followed Mance. They won't follow anyone else.
3651,3,4,JON,What about you?
3652,3,4,TORMUND,Hard to lead when you're in chains.
3653,3,4,JON,What if I unchained you?
3654,3,4,TORMUND,Why would you do that?
3655,3,4,JON,Because you are not my enemy. And I'm not yours.
3656,3,4,TORMUND,You sure seemed like my enemy when you were killing my friends.
3657,3,4,JON,"For 8,000 years the Night's Watch have sworn an oath to be the shield that guards the realms of men. And for 8,000 years we've fallen short of that oath. You belong to the realms of men. All of you."
3658,3,4,TORMUND,And now everything is going to change?
3659,3,4,JON,It is.
3660,3,4,TORMUND,Why now?
3661,3,4,JON,"Because now, (Leans forward), I am Lord Commander of the Night's Watch."
3662,3,4,TORMUND,"What would you have me do, (Leans forward), Lord Commander?"
3663,3,4,JON,(Stands up). I'd have you go north of the Wall. Gather the remaining free folk wherever they are and bring them back here. I'll open the gates for them and let them through. I'll find them lands to settle south of the Wall.
3664,3,4,TORMUND,They won't kneel for you and neither will I.
3665,3,4,JON,I don't want them to kneel for me. I want them to fight with me when the time comes.
3666,3,4,TORMUND,The day I ask my people to fight with the crows is the day my people cut my guts from my belly and make me eat them.
3667,3,4,JON,"And how many of your people can't fight? The women, the children, the old, the sick, what happens to them? You're condemning them to death. Worse than death because you're too proud to make peace. Or maybe you're not proud. Maybe you're just a coward."
3668,3,4,TORMUND,(Stands up). Easy thing to say to a man in chains. Jon unchains Tormund. Tormund’s eyes widen as he feels his hands.
3669,3,4,JON,Your people need a leader. And they need to get south of the Wall before it's too late. We don't have much time and they have less. The walkers are coming and they'll hit your people first. I'm not asking you to make peace to save your skin. Make peace to save your people.
3670,3,4,TORMUND,Most of them are at Hardhome. You know where that is?
3671,3,4,JON,Up on Storrold's Point. I can give you 10 horses and nine other men. You can get there in a week.
3672,3,4,TORMUND,We'll need ships.
3673,3,4,JON,I'll talk to King Stannis about lending you his fleet.
3674,3,4,TORMUND,"All right, then. You're coming with me. You're the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. They need to hear it from you. They need to know the ships they are boarding won’t be torched in the middle of the sea. You come with me, or I don't go. INT. DINING HALL The Night’s Watchmen present talk amongst themselves. Stannis and Davos are present. Jon stands at a table in the front of the room with Allister and two others. One of them addresses Jon. MAN 1: You'd bring wildlings here, through our gates?"
3675,3,4,JON,"Men, women, and children will die by the thousands if we do nothing. MAN 1: Let them die. We got our own to worry about. Less enemies for us. Some of the men in the crowd cheer."
3676,3,4,STANNIS,Fewer .
3677,3,4,DAVOS,What?
3678,3,4,STANNIS,Nothing.
3679,3,4,SAM,"(Standing up) There is good farmland in the Gift. (Laughter). Land that no one uses now. A dozen abandoned villages. MAN 2: And why do you think the farmers abandoned those villages? Because the wildlings raided them for years. Cut them down! Just like they did this boy's people. The man points to Olly, who lowers his head. Sam sits down."
3680,3,4,ALLISTER,We've been fighting them all for thousands of years. They've slaughtered villages. They've slaughtered our brothers.
3681,3,4,JON,And we've slaughtered theirs.
3682,3,4,EDD,"I will follow you anywhere, you know that. But they killed Grenn. And they killed Pyp. (Men mumble in agreement). They killed 50 of our brothers. I can't forget that. I can't forgive it."
3683,3,4,JON,"You were at the Fist of the First Men. If we abandon them, you know what they become. We can learn to live with the wildlings or we can add them to the army of the dead. Whatever they are now, they're better than that. The men in the room return to bickering loudly. INT. LORD COMMANDER’S ROOM Jon walks in, takes off his coat, and puts his hands on his desk. Olly knocks and walks in with a plate of food, and sets it down."
3684,3,4,JON,"Thank you. (Olly walks away). Olly. (He stops). If you have something you want to say to me, say it. It's all right."
3685,3,4,OLLY,"You don't mean it, do you? Telling the wildlings you want to make peace. You're just doing it to trick them."
3686,3,4,JON,It's not a trick.
3687,3,4,OLLY,"They burned my village. They put an arrow through my father's head right in front of me. They butchered my mother, everyone I ever knew."
3688,3,4,JON,I know what it's like to lose the people you love. I know this is hard for you. But winter is coming. We know what's coming with it. We can't face it alone.
3689,3,4,OLLY,"Will there be anything else you need, Lord Commander?"
3690,3,4,JON,No. Olly leaves. Jon sighs.
3691,3,4,TO,"WINTERFELL EXT. COURTYARD Podrick walks carrying some supplies. He enters a building. Inside, Brienne stares out of a window. Podrick sets down the supplies."
3692,3,4,PODRICK,She's far away from the Lannisters. This is her home. Maybe Lady Sansa is better off here.
3693,3,4,BRIENNE,(Turns around). Better off with the Boltons who murdered her mother and brother? Sansa's in danger even if she doesn't realize it. A man enters with some water and a towel.
3694,3,4,BRIENNE,Thank you. You've lived here a long time?
3695,3,4,MAN,Aye.
3696,3,4,BRIENNE,Did you know Lord Eddard?
3697,3,4,MAN,I knew him and his father before him. The Starks are gone now.
3698,3,4,BRIENNE,Not all of them. I know who's inside that castle.
3699,3,4,MAN,Everyone knows. The Boltons.
3700,3,4,BRIENNE,I'm not talking about the Boltons. I need to get a message to her. To Sansa Stark.
3701,3,4,MAN,Who are you?
3702,3,4,BRIENNE,Someone who swore to keep her safe.
3703,3,4,MAN,Swore to who?
3704,3,4,BRIENNE,Her mother.
3705,3,4,MAN,Her mother's dead.
3706,3,4,BRIENNE,That doesn't release me from an oath. I served Lady Catelyn. I serve her still. Who do you serve? INT. RAMSAY’S CHAMBERS Myranda stands naked in front of a window.
3707,3,4,RAMSAY,Come back here. Myranda.
3708,3,4,MYRANDA,I saw you staring at her.
3709,3,4,RAMSAY,I'm going to marry her. That will involve looking at her from time to time.
3710,3,4,MYRANDA,You said you'd marry me.
3711,3,4,RAMSAY,And I meant it. When I was a bastard named Snow. But I'm a Bolton now. What I want is no longer the primary consideration. I'm furthering a dynasty.
3712,3,4,MYRANDA,Do you think she's pretty?
3713,3,4,RAMSAY,Of course I do. I'm not blind. Ramsay sighs and gets up. He walks over to Myranda and grabs her waist.
3714,3,4,RAMSAY,"You think she's pretty, too. I'm looking forward to our wedding night. But don't worry, I'll have plenty of time for you."
3715,3,4,MYRANDA,"Perhaps I'll marry, too."
3716,3,4,RAMSAY,"(Laughs). You're the kennel master's daughter. Who are you going to marry, the stable keeper's son? (She tries to hit him, but he restrains her). You're mine. You're not going anywhere. Unless I have to listen to more of your jealousy. Jealousy bores me. You remember what happens to people who bore me. You're not going to bore me, are you, Myranda? After a moment, Myranda kisses him. She then bites down hard on his lower lip, causing it to bleed."
3717,3,4,MYRANDA,"(Smiles). Never. Ramsay smiles back. They begin having sex. INT. SANSA’S CHAMBERS Sansa sits alone at a table. There’s a knock on the door. She turns, gets up, and opens it. An old servant woman comes in."
3718,3,4,WOMAN,"Beg pardon, my lady. I've come to refill the wash basin."
3719,3,4,SANSA,"Oh, I don't need-"
3720,3,4,WOMAN,"(Closes the door). You still have friends in the North. If you're ever in trouble, light a candle in the highest window of the broken tower."
3721,3,4,SANSA,But who -
3722,3,4,WOMAN,"You're not alone. The woman leaves, and closes the door. EXT. OUTSIDE Sansa walks through the snow, looking up at the broken tower. Myranda approaches her."
3723,3,4,MYRANDA,I like your dress. Who made it for you?
3724,3,4,SANSA,I made it myself.
3725,3,4,MYRANDA,Really?
3726,3,4,SANSA,"Who, who are you?"
3727,3,4,MYRANDA,"I'm Myranda, the kennel master's daughter. May I? (Takes Sansa’s arm and inspects her sleeve). Oh, wonderful. The stitching. Who taught you?"
3728,3,4,SANSA,My mother. (Pulls away).
3729,3,4,MYRANDA,I'm sorry for what happened to her.
3730,3,4,SANSA,Thank you.
3731,3,4,MYRANDA,"It's good that she taught you. It was a gift. Now every time you wear something you made, you can remember her."
3732,3,4,SANSA,I'd rather have a mother.
3733,3,4,MYRANDA,"I know. It's not the same. Still, it's good to remember. Remember the way things were. I almost forgot. There's something else to help you remember. INT. DUNGEON ENTRANCE Myranda opens the gate and lets Sansa in. Some dogs bark."
3734,3,4,MYRANDA,Down there at the end.
3735,3,4,SANSA,What is it?
3736,3,4,MYRANDA,"That would spoil the surprise. Go ahead, it's perfectly safe. You won't believe it when you see it. The dogs continue barking and growling. Sansa walks down the aisle of cages. Most contain dogs. Sansa looks behind to see Myranda has disappeared. She comes to the last cage, which is open. Inside is Theon, on the floor. He gets up and notices her."
3737,3,4,SANSA,Theon?
3738,3,4,THEON,You shouldn't be here. She looks at him angrily. He backs away from her. She leaves. INT. RAMSAY’S CHAMBERS Theon unties Ramsay’s jacket.
3739,3,4,RAMSAY,"You smell particularly ripe this evening. Pour me some wine. Theon walks over to a table and pours some wine. He then brings it over to Ramsay, who drinks it."
3740,3,4,RAMSAY,Do you have something to tell me?
3741,3,4,THEON,"No, my lord."
3742,3,4,RAMSAY,Reek.
3743,3,4,THEON,(Stuttering). She saw me.
3744,3,4,RAMSAY,Who?
3745,3,4,THEON,Sansa. Lady Sansa. She came to the kennels.
3746,3,4,RAMSAY,She saw you?
3747,3,4,THEON,"Yes. I'm sorry, master. Forgive me. I didn't think -"
3748,3,4,RAMSAY,Come here. Theon walks forward. Ramsay holds his chin.
3749,3,4,RAMSAY,"You mustn't keep secrets from me, Reek. Get on your knees. Theon gets on his knees. Ramsay sips his wine, and then puts it aside. Theon looks down."
3750,3,4,RAMSAY,"Give me your hand. Theon hesitantly holds his hand up. As Ramsay takes it, Theon begins stammering. After a moment, Ramsay cups Theon’s hand with his own hands."
3751,3,4,RAMSAY,"I forgive you. Theon looks up. Ramsay smiles. INT. DINING HALL Sansa, Ramsay, Roose, and Walda sit at a table, eating."
3752,3,4,ROOSE,"I trust you find your chamber suitable, my lady."
3753,3,4,SANSA,"Yes, thank you, my lord."
3754,3,4,RAMSAY,Allow me. Ramsay pours Sansa some wine.
3755,3,4,RAMSAY,Mother.
3756,3,4,WALDA,"Thank you, Ramsay. He pours her some wine as well. She smiles. Ramsay gets up and holds his wine up."
3757,3,4,RAMSAY,"My lady, we are all a family, we northerners. Our blood ties go back thousands of years. So I'd like to drink to our wedding. May our happiness spread from Moat Cailin to the Last Hearth."
3758,3,4,ROOSE,(Raises his cup). To your wedding.
3759,3,4,WALDA,(Raises her cup). To your wedding. Ramsay takes a large sip of wine. Sansa puts her own glass down. Ramsay sits down.
3760,3,4,WALDA,It must be difficult for you being in a strange place.
3761,3,4,SANSA,This isn't a strange place. This is my home. It's the people who are strange.
3762,3,4,RAMSAY,"You're right. Very strange. More wine, please. Theon enters the room with some wine. Sansa looks away."
3763,3,4,RAMSAY,"I heard you two had reunited. A fitting place for it. (Theon begins pouring wine). I like to imagine that the last time you spoke was in this very room. Are you still angry with him after he - what he did? Don't worry. The North remembers. I punished him for it. He's not ironborn anymore. Not Theon Greyjoy anymore. He's a new man. A new person, anyway. Aren't you, Reek?"
3764,3,4,THEON,"(Turns around). Yes, master."
3765,3,4,RAMSAY,"That's his new name, Reek."
3766,3,4,SANSA,Why are you doing this?
3767,3,4,RAMSAY,"Because Reek has something to say to you. Don't you, Reek? (He gestures Theon over). An apology. Apologize to Lady Sansa for what you did. Apologize for murdering her two brothers. Theon shakes his head ""no"" when Ramsay looks away"
3768,3,4,THEON,"(After a moment, stuttering). I'm sorry."
3769,3,4,RAMSAY,"Look at her, Reek. An apology doesn't mean anything if you're not looking the person in the eye."
3770,3,4,THEON,I'm sorry.
3771,3,4,RAMSAY,Sorry about what?
3772,3,4,THEON,For killing your brothers.
3773,3,4,RAMSAY,"There, over and done with. Doesn't everyone feel better? I do. That was getting very tense. Whew. (Theon turns to leave). You know what, my lady? What with him having murdered your brothers and the rest of your family gone Reek here is the nearest thing to living kin that you have left. Reek. You will give away the bride. Someone has to. What better person? Good? Good?"
3774,3,4,ROOSE,"Yes, yes, very good."
3775,3,4,RAMSAY,Wonderful. (Sips wine).
3776,3,4,ROOSE,"Walda and I have some good news as well, since we're all together."
3777,3,4,WALDA,We're going to have a baby.
3778,3,4,SANSA,I'm very happy for you.
3779,3,4,ROOSE,"From the way she's carrying, Maester Wolkan says it looks like a boy. Ramsay sips some wine and angrily sets his cup down. Sansa looks at him smugly. INT. ROOSE’S WAR ROOM Ramsay and Roose sit at a war table."
3780,3,4,RAMSAY,How can you be sure?
3781,3,4,ROOSE,Sure of what?
3782,3,4,RAMSAY,That she's pregnant. I mean how can you tell?
3783,3,4,ROOSE,"Maester Wolkan has assured us beyond all doubt. Ramsay gets up and walks around to the other side of the table, wine in hand."
3784,3,4,RAMSAY,So how did you manage it?
3785,3,4,ROOSE,Manage what?
3786,3,4,RAMSAY,Getting her pregnant.
3787,3,4,ROOSE,I imagine you're familiar with the procedure.
3788,3,4,RAMSAY,"Of course, but how did you find it?"
3789,3,4,ROOSE,"You disgraced yourself at dinner, parading that creature before the Stark girl."
3790,3,4,RAMSAY,And if it's a boy?
3791,3,4,ROOSE,You're worried about your position.
3792,3,4,RAMSAY,My position is quite clear. I'm your son until a better alternative comes along. Ramsay finished his wine and goes to get more.
3793,3,4,ROOSE,You've never asked me about your mother.
3794,3,4,RAMSAY,"Why would I? She had me, she died. And here we are."
3795,3,4,ROOSE,"She was a peasant girl. Pretty in a common sort of way. She was the miller's wife. Apparently they had married without my knowledge or consent. So I had him hanged and I took her beneath the tree where he was swaying. She fought me the whole time. She was lucky I didn't hang her, too. A year later she came to my gates with a squalling baby in her arms. A baby she claimed was mine. I nearly had her whipped and the child thrown in the river. (Stands up). But then I looked at you and I saw then what I see now. You are my son. (After a moment). Stannis Baratheon has an army at Castle Black. But he won't stay for long. He wants the Iron Throne, and the road to King's Landing comes right through Winterfell. He means to take the North. But the North is ours. It's yours and mine. Will you help me defeat him?"
3796,3,4,RAMSAY,Yes.
3797,3,4,TO,"CASTLE BLACK INT. LIBRARY Gilly walks through the bookshelves, examining them. Sam sits at the table reading."
3798,3,4,GILLY,Is this every book there is?
3799,3,4,SAM,Every book there is?
3800,3,4,GILLY,In the world.
3801,3,4,SAM,"Well, no. There are thousands and thousands of books out there. This library is rather small, actually."
3802,3,4,GILLY,"Where you grew up, were there more books?"
3803,3,4,SAM,My father's not the most literate man. They say the Citadel has the largest library in the world.
3804,3,4,GILLY,Where's that?
3805,3,4,SAM,The Citadel? In Oldtown.
3806,3,4,GILLY,I'm sorry I don't know things.
3807,3,4,SAM,"Gilly, look at me. You know how to do a hundred things I can never do. You can build a fire with wet wood. You can cook. You can stitch a wound."
3808,3,4,GILLY,I can wash the linens. I can sweep the floor.
3809,3,4,SAM,Well -
3810,3,4,GILLY,Why does the Citadel have the biggest library?
3811,3,4,SAM,It's where they train the maesters.
3812,3,4,GILLY,Like Maester Aemon?
3813,3,4,SAM,"I wanted to be one when I was young. Instead, I became a man of the Night's Watch. Far more adventure up here anyway. I wouldn't have met you. Stannis enters the library. Sam stands up."
3814,3,4,SAM,"Ah, Your Grace. Gilly quickly exits."
3815,3,4,STANNIS,You're Samwell Tarly?
3816,3,4,SAM,"I am, Your Grace."
3817,3,4,STANNIS,"Your father is Randyll Tarly. He defeated my brother at the Battle of Ashford. Only battle Robert ever lost. I told him he shouldn't go so far west so soon, but he never listened. Fine soldier, your father. You don't look like a soldier. But I'm told you killed a white walker."
3818,3,4,SAM,"I did, Your Grace."
3819,3,4,STANNIS,How?
3820,3,4,SAM,With a dagger made of dragonglass.
3821,3,4,STANNIS,Dragonglass?
3822,3,4,SAM,What the maesters call obsidian -
3823,3,4,STANNIS,I know what it is. We have it in Dragonstone. Why would obsidian kill a walker?
3824,3,4,SAM,"I don't know. I've been going through all the old manuscripts hoping to find something, and all I've learned is that the children of the forest used to hunt with dragonglass."
3825,3,4,STANNIS,The Lady Melisandre told me that death marches on the Wall.
3826,3,4,SAM,"I've seen it, Your Grace."
3827,3,4,STANNIS,Seen what?
3828,3,4,SAM,The army of the dead. And when they come -
3829,3,4,STANNIS,"We have to know how to fight them. (After a moment). Keep reading, Samwell Tarly. Stannis leaves. INT. DINING HALL Davos carves away at a piece of wood. Stannis approaches him."
3830,3,4,STANNIS,It's time.
3831,3,4,DAVOS,"Uh, Your Grace. Wouldn't it be better to wait? When Jon Snow returns with the wildlings, we could have thousands more men."
3832,3,4,STANNIS,"If Jon Snow returns with the wildlings. We can't wait that long. We have the advantage, more men, more horses, all fed and rested. But every day we wait, the odds shift in Bolton's favor. This could turn to winter at any moment. We have to act now. Give the order. We march at sunrise."
3833,3,4,DAVOS,I'll choose a dozen men to stay and guard the queen and the princess.
3834,3,4,STANNIS,"No need, they're coming with us."
3835,3,4,DAVOS,"It's a tough road ahead, Your Grace. Won't they be safer -"
3836,3,4,STANNIS,"Here? Half these watchmen are killers and rapists. No, they march with us. They walk outside."
3837,3,4,DAVOS,"As you wish, Your Grace. Stannis walks away. Davos spots Melisandre. EXT. COURTYARD - THE NEXT MORNING Stannis’s men prepare to ride out. Sam and Gilly watch. Gilly holds baby Sam. Olly, Edd, and some other watchmen are also shown watching."
3838,3,4,SHIREEN,(On horseback). Do you think Father will let me go down into the crypt?
3839,3,4,DAVOS,Beg your pardon?
3840,3,4,SHIREEN,At Winterfell. All the Kings in the North are buried there. Bran the Builder and King Dorren and-
3841,3,4,DAVOS,First things first. It's a long march ahead. And then we have to take the castle.
3842,3,4,SHIREEN,Is there going to be a battle?
3843,3,4,DAVOS,"Aye, princess, but you won't be anywhere near -"
3844,3,4,SELYSE,"That's enough talk of battle, Ser Davos. You'll scare the child."
3845,3,4,DAVOS,"Yes, my queen."
3846,3,4,SHIREEN,I'm not scared.
3847,3,4,DAVOS,"Well, I am. When the battle comes, promise you'll protect me."
3848,3,4,SHIREEN,"(Smiling). I promise. Shireen looks back at Gilly. Selyse catches her, and she looks down and away. Jon walks through the courtyard. He and Stannis meet on some stairs."
3849,3,4,STANNIS,I hope you know what you're doing with these wildlings. I need those ships.
3850,3,4,JON,"You'll get them back, I swear it. Have a safe journey, Your Grace. And thank you. Jon watches Stannis walk away and get on his horse. He makes eye contact with Melisandre, but she looks away. Stannis and his army begin leaving."
3851,3,4,TO,"MEEREN INT. GREY WORM’S ROOM Missandei watches over Grey Worm. He suddenly gets up, startling her."
3852,3,4,MISSANDEI,You're still too weak. (He lays back down).
3853,3,4,WORM,(Valyrian) How long have I been here?
3854,3,4,MISSANDEI,(Valyrian) Three days. He looks at her. His face is bruised.
3855,3,4,WORM,Ser Barristan? Missandei shakes her head.
3856,3,4,WORM,"(Valyrian) I failed him. I failed my men, I failed my queen."
3857,3,4,MISSANDEI,"(Valyrian) You failed no one. You fought bravely. You’ll fight again. (In Common Tongue) Are you ashamed? You were ambushed, outnumbered. There was no way you could have known."
3858,3,4,WORM,"This is not why. Wounded in war, there is no shame for this. I am ashamed because when the knife go in and I fall to the ground, I am afraid."
3859,3,4,MISSANDEI,All men fear death.
3860,3,4,WORM,"No, not death. I fear I never again see Missandei from the Island of Naath. Missandei looks down, on the verge of tears. She gets up and lies down in the bed with him, caressing his face, and then kissing him. INT. DAENERYS’S CHAMBERS Missandei and Daenerys stand, talking."
3861,3,4,MISSANDEI,Now you have given the Masters what they deserve.
3862,3,4,DAENERYS,"If I give everyone what they deserve, I'll have no one left to rule. Ser Barristan counseled mercy when I took this city right up to the morning he died. Daario Naharis thinks I should kill the former Masters and let the rest of the city fend for itself. What do you think?"
3863,3,4,MISSANDEI,"Your Grace, I think that I am not fit to have an opinion on these matters."
3864,3,4,DAENERYS,(Sitting down). You are as fit as anyone I know. You know why I'm here. And you know who will suffer the most if this all falls apart. So what do you think?
3865,3,4,MISSANDEI,"I can only tell you what I have seen, Your Grace. (Sitting down). I have seen you listen to your counselors. I have seen you lean on their experience when your own was lacking and weigh the choices they put before you. And I have seen you ignore your counselors, because there was a better choice. One that only you could see. INT. DUNGEONS Daenerys is led by Unsullied to a room in a dungeon. The door is opened to reveal Hizdahr. She enters, and he kneels before her."
3866,3,4,HIZDAHR,"My, my queen, please do not do this."
3867,3,4,DAENERYS,"What about ""Valar Morghulis""?"
3868,3,4,HIZDAHR,I did not want to die a coward. Apparently I do not want to die at all. (Sniffles).
3869,3,4,DAENERYS,"It takes courage to admit fear. And to admit a mistake. I came here to tell you that I was wrong. I was wrong and you were right. About tradition. About bringing the people of this city together. I will reopen the fighting pits. To free men only. Slavery will never return to Meereen, not while I live."
3870,3,4,HIZDAHR,"Yes, my queen."
3871,3,4,DAENERYS,"And in order to forge a lasting bond with the Meereenese people, I will marry the leader of an ancient family. (Hizdahr nods). Thankfully a suitor is already on his knees. Hizdahr looks surprised. Daenerys faintly smiles, and then leaves. Hizdahr is left in the cell, with the door wide open."
3872,3,4,TO,SEA EXT. JORAH’S BOAT Tyrion wakes up and feels his head.
3873,3,4,TYRION,"Don't worry. I'll be fine. Nothing broken, I don't think. Where are we now? Not the Rhoyne. (No response). Long, sullen silences and an occasional punch in the face. The Mormont way. Let's start over. I apologize for before. My mouth sometimes runs away from me. This doesn't have to be an unpleasant trip. We're going to be spending a lot of time together on the way to Meereen."
3874,3,4,JORAH,We are.
3875,3,4,TYRION,What would make our time together truly enjoyable would be some wine.
3876,3,4,JORAH,No wine.
3877,3,4,TYRION,"I am a person who drinks. People who drink need to keep drinking. Otherwise, they're not… Jorah stands up and looks ahead. Tyrion turns as well. A large bank of fog lies ahead of the boat."
3878,3,4,TYRION,I know where we are. You're taking us through Valyria.
3879,3,4,JORAH,I am.
3880,3,4,TYRION,Have you sailed this route before?
3881,3,4,JORAH,No.
3882,3,4,TYRION,You're going to bring Daenerys a souvenir from her ancestral homeland in case I'm not enough?
3883,3,4,JORAH,I think you'll be plenty.
3884,3,4,TYRION,You know what they say. The Doom still rules Valyria. What about the demons and the flames? Aren't you afraid of the Doom?
3885,3,4,JORAH,No. But the pirates are.
3886,3,4,TYRION,Oh. EXT. RIVER SURROUNDED BY WOODS
3887,3,4,TYRION,The Smoking Sea. How many centuries before we learn how to build cities like this again? Thousands of years the Valyrians were the best in the world at almost everything. And then -
3888,3,4,JORAH,And then they weren't.
3889,3,4,TYRION,"And then they weren't. ""They held each other close and turned their backs upon the end. The hills that split asunder and the black that ate the skies; The flames that shot so high and hot that even dragons burned; Would never be the final sights that fell upon their eyes. A fly upon a wall, the waves the sea wind whipped and churned -"""
3890,3,4,JORAH,"""The city of a thousand years, and all that men had learned; The Doom consumed it all alike, and neither of them turned."""
3891,3,4,TYRION,I would clap. He holds up his bound hands. Jorah smirks.
3892,3,4,TYRION,"I suppose this is it, then. This is what remains. They look at the approaching ruins of the city. Suddenly Tyrion spots Drogon passing overhead. He stands up. Both of them look up and watch as he passes. Behind Tyrion, someone hops in the water. Jorah hears the splash and turns to see the ripples."
3893,3,4,TYRION,What was that? The boat passes into a tunnel. A Stone Man jumps down into the boat from the ceiling.
3894,3,4,JORAH,Stone Men! Don't let them touch you! Jorah hits the stone man from behind before he gets to Tyrion. They begin fighting. Another stone man jumps into the water and begins trying to get on the boat. Tyrion tries to keep him off. Jorah manages to push the first man into the water. He then begins fighting the other one.
3895,3,4,JORAH,Get behind!
3896,3,4,TYRION,"Mormont, cut me free! (Jorah falls into the water). Mormont! Jorah climbs back onto the boat and fights off the stone man. He manages to get his sword and cuts the stone man. The other stone man inches his way towards Tyrion."
3897,3,4,TYRION,"Mormont! Mormont! Jorah cuts through the stone man he was fighting and pushes him into the water. Tyrion rolls into the water to avoid the other one. He desperately tries to remove the rope around his hands. A stone man grabs his ankle and begins attempting to pull him down. The screen fades to black. After a few moments, we see Tyrion’s perspective. Jorah stands over him as his eyes slowly blink open. EXT. SHORE"
3898,3,4,JORAH,(Faintly). Tyrion? Tyrion. Tyrion. Tyrion. You're all right. Tyrion looks around. Jorah helps him up. He unsheathes his knife and cuts Tyrion’s binds.
3899,3,4,JORAH,You're heavier than you look. Did any of them touch you?
3900,3,4,TYRION,"(Shakes his head). You? (Jorah shakes his head). I've seen greyscale before, but nothing like that."
3901,3,4,JORAH,I suppose that's why they send them there.
3902,3,4,TYRION,"It'd be kinder to put daggers in their hearts and be done with it. (Jorah spits). Thank you for saving me. Of course, I wouldn't have needed saving if you hadn't kidnapped me in the first place. (Jorah gets up). So what now?"
3903,3,4,JORAH,"We walk, up the coast. With luck, we'll find a fishing village. Maybe another boat."
3904,3,4,TYRION,Without luck?
3905,3,4,JORAH,"We've got a long walk ahead of us. I'll get some wood for a fire. Try to get some rest, huh?"
3906,3,5,DEFAULT,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken Script Lyrics INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE - CHAMBER Arya cleans, washes, and covers three different bodies. Two Faceless Men come in to carry the body away. Arya tries to follow them but the waif closes and locks the door."
3907,3,5,ARYA,What are they doing with the bodies?
3908,3,5,WAIF,Get back to work.
3909,3,5,ARYA,No! I’ve been here for weeks. I’m not scrubbing one more corpse until you tell me why I’m doing it.
3910,3,5,WAIF,You will know why.
3911,3,5,ARYA,When?
3912,3,5,WAIF,When it’s time. Not before. Get back to work.
3913,3,5,ARYA,When do I get to play the game?
3914,3,5,WAIF,Game?
3915,3,5,ARYA,The game. The game of faces.
3916,3,5,WAIF,You tried already. You failed.
3917,3,5,ARYA,I didn’t even know I was playing.
3918,3,5,WAIF,Who are you?
3919,3,5,ARYA,No one.
3920,3,5,WAIF,Get back to work.
3921,3,5,ARYA,Well who are you? What are you doing here? How’d you get here?
3922,3,5,WAIF,"I’m from Westeros. Just like you. Daughter of a Lord. Just like you. Except I was an only child. Heir to his fortune. My mother died. My father remarried and his new wife gave birth to a girl. My stepmother didn’t want any rivals for her precious daughter so she tried to kill me with poison. I found out, sought help from the Faceless Men and my father was widowed again. I’ve been serving them ever since. beat"
3923,3,5,WAIF,Was that true or a lie?
3924,3,5,ARYA,What?
3925,3,5,WAIF,Did you believe every word I said? Arya is unsure.
3926,3,5,WAIF,Get back to work. INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE - CHAMBERS - NIGHT Arya is asleep.
3927,3,5,JAQEN,Who are you? Arya wakes up and turns to him.
3928,3,5,JAQEN,Who are you?
3929,3,5,ARYA,Arya.
3930,3,5,JAQEN,And where did you come from?
3931,3,5,ARYA,Westeros. My family home is Winterfell. I’m the youngest daughter of a great lord. Eddard Stark. He died in battle. Jaqen hits Arya with a stick.
3932,3,5,JAQEN,A lie.
3933,3,5,ARYA,After he was executed I fled the capital. Had to kill a stable boy. Drove my sword through his back. Jaqen hits her again.
3934,3,5,JAQEN,A lie.
3935,3,5,ARYA,I stabbed him in the gut. I tried to find my mother and brother. I never did. They were murdered by Walder Frey. An outlaw kidnapped me. A man called Polliver. Jaqen hits her.
3936,3,5,JAQEN,A lie.
3937,3,5,ARYA,"A man called the Hound. Sandor Clegane. He tried to sell me but was wounded in a fight. He begged me to kill him but I wouldn’t. I left him in the mountains to die. I wanted him to suffer, I hated him. Jaqen hits her."
3938,3,5,ARYA,I hated him. Jaqen hits her.
3939,3,5,ARYA,I hated him! Jaqen hits her again.
3940,3,5,ARYA,That’s not a lie!
3941,3,5,JAQEN,The girl lies. To me. To the Many Faced God. To herself. Does she truly want to be no one?
3942,3,5,ARYA,Yes. Jaqen hits her. Arya starts bleeding from the mouth.
3943,3,5,ARYA,I’m not playing this stupid game anymore!
3944,3,5,JAQEN,We never stop playing. Jaqen exits the room. EXT. SHORE Jorah inspects the Grey Scale then covers it up.
3945,3,5,TYRION,"So, those villages we were supposed to find. We can’t live on berries and roots."
3946,3,5,JORAH,I can.
3947,3,5,TYRION,You’re not hungry?
3948,3,5,JORAH,Of course I’m hungry.
3949,3,5,TYRION,"You’re an awful travelling companion, do you know that? Possibly the least charming man I have ever met."
3950,3,5,JORAH,I am not your travelling companion.
3951,3,5,TYRION,We are travelling together. In each other’s company. Therefore…
3952,3,5,JORAH,Do you ever shut up?
3953,3,5,TYRION,I sailed from King’s Landing to Pentos in a crate. Without ever saying a word. Jorah sits down next to Tyrion.
3954,3,5,JORAH,Why?
3955,3,5,TYRION,Never occurred to you to ask why until now? You never wondered why Tyrion Lannister decided to visit a brothel in Volantis.
3956,3,5,JORAH,I’m sure you’ve visited many brothels in many cities.
3957,3,5,TYRION,I killed my father. He wanted to execute me for a crime I didn’t commit. And he was fucking the woman I loved. Jorah gets up.
3958,3,5,TYRION,"As miserable as you are, Mormont, at least your father was a good man."
3959,3,5,JORAH,What do you know about my father?
3960,3,5,TYRION,"I met him. I visited the Wall. When I asked him about his men he knew all the stories, every one of them. He actually cared about the people in his command. How did they put it in the Watch? “We shall never see his like again.” Jorah looks stunned."
3961,3,5,TYRION,You didn’t know. I’m sorry. I am.
3962,3,5,JORAH,How?
3963,3,5,TYRION,I only know what I heard JORAH (stronger): How?
3964,3,5,TYRION,He was leading an expedition beyond the wall. There was a mutiny. He was murdered by his own men.
3965,3,5,JORAH,"We better keep moving. He gets up and walks away, then Tyrion. INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE Arya is scrubbing the floor. A man carries a young girl in and sets her by the pool. He walks over to Arya and she stops scrubbing."
3966,3,5,MAN,Valar morghulis.
3967,3,5,ARYA,Valar dohaeris.
3968,3,5,MAN,I have nowhere else to go. I’ve taken her to every healer in Braavos. I’ve spent every penny I had. She suffers every day of her life. I just want it to end. Arya looks the man in the eyes then walks over to the girl.
3969,3,5,GIRL,It hurts.
3970,3,5,ARYA,"I know. Don’t be afraid. I used to be like you. I was sick. I was dying. But my father never gave up on me. He loved me. More than anything in the world, just like your father loves you. So he brought me here. My father prayed to the many faced god. And I drank the water from this fountain. It healed me. Arya fills a cup with the water."
3971,3,5,ARYA,"I’ve devoted my life to him now. You don’t want to hurt anymore. Drink. The girl takes a sip. Jaqen watches from afar. INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE - BODY ROOM Arya fixes the dead girl’s hair. Jaqen walks in from the door Arya was trying to open earlier and leads her in. Arya follows him down a staircase lit by fire. INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE - HALL OF FACES Arya looks up and sees the room is filled with columns containing the faces of the dead. She walks through the room, examining the faces."
3972,3,5,JAQEN,"Is the girl ready to give up her ears, her nose, her tongue, her hopes and dreams, her loves and hates, all that makes a girl who she is, forever? Arya scans through the faces then fixates on one face in particular - that of an old lady."
3973,3,5,JAQEN,No. The girl is not ready to become no one. But she is ready to become someone else. EXT. COUNTRYSIDE
3974,3,5,TYRION,"Why Daenerys? Why is she worth all this? As I recall, the Mormonts fought against the Targaryens during Robert’s Rebellion."
3975,3,5,JORAH,Do you believe in anything?
3976,3,5,TYRION,I believe in many things.
3977,3,5,JORAH,"In something greater than ourselves, I mean. The Gods. Destiny. Do you believe there's a plan for this world?"
3978,3,5,TYRION,No.
3979,3,5,JORAH,"Neither did I. I was a cynic, just like you. Then I saw a girl step into a great fire with three stone eggs. When the fire burned out I thought I’d find her blackened bones. Instead I found her. Daenerys. Alive and unhurt. Holding her baby dragons. Have you ever heard baby dragons singing?"
3980,3,5,TYRION,No.
3981,3,5,JORAH,It's hard to be a cynic after that.
3982,3,5,TYRION,Doesn’t mean she’s going to be a great queen.
3983,3,5,JORAH,No it doesn’t.
3984,3,5,TYRION,"The Targaryens are famously insane. What if she conquers the world? Then what? 1,000 years of peace and prosperity?"
3985,3,5,JORAH,First we have to conquer the world.
3986,3,5,TYRION,"We? Alright, let’s assume your dreams come true. She’s ecstatic when you bring her this enemy dwarf. She hacks off my head and restores your position. You command her army, sail to Westeros, defeat all your enemies, then watch as she climbs those steps and sits on the Iron Throne. Hurrah, long live the Queen. Then what?"
3987,3,5,JORAH,Then she rules.
3988,3,5,TYRION,So a woman who has not spent a single day of her adult life in Westeros becomes the ruler of Westeros? That’s justice?
3989,3,5,JORAH,She is the rightful heir.
3990,3,5,TYRION,"Why, because her father who burned living men for amusement was the king? Jorah sees a ship anchored in the middle of the sea and pushes Tyrion behind a rock."
3991,3,5,JORAH,Shh! It’s a slave ship
3992,3,5,TYRION,Why is it anchored?
3993,3,5,JORAH,They probably came ashore for--
3994,3,5,MALKO,"--water. Malko and his men, all carrying swords, surround Tyrion and Jorah, smiling. SAME PLACE - LATER Tyrion and Jorah’s hands are tied. Malko punches Jorah in the face. He gets up."
3995,3,5,MALKO,"Got a lot of fight in you, huh? Malko punches Jorah again."
3996,3,5,SLAVER,Salt mines.
3997,3,5,MALKO,That or a galley slave. He looks strong enough.
3998,3,5,SLAVER,What about the dwarf?
3999,3,5,MALKO,Worthless. Cut his throat. The slaver’s man approaches Tyrion.
4000,3,5,TYRION,"Wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait, let’s discuss this!"
4001,3,5,MALKO,And then chop off his cock. We can sell it for a fortune. A dwarf’s cock has magic powers. The slaver puts his sword to Tyrion’s throat.
4002,3,5,TYRION,"Wait, wait, wait, wait! You can’t just hand a dried cock to a merchant and expect him to pay for it. He has to know it came from a dwarf. And how could he know unless he sees the dwarf?"
4003,3,5,SLAVER,It will be a dwarf-sized cock.
4004,3,5,TYRION,Guess again. Tyrion looks to Malko.
4005,3,5,MALKO,The dwarf lives until we find a cock merchant. The slavers get Jorah and Tyrion to their feet.
4006,3,5,JORAH,Queen Daenerys has outlawed slavery.
4007,3,5,MALKO,"We’re bound to Volantis, not Slaver’s Bay. Besides, she reopened the fighting pits. I never heard of free men fighting in the pits."
4008,3,5,TYRION,"The fighting puts in Mereen! You’re in luck then, you’re about to be rich. You are looking at one of the great warriors in the seven kingdoms. Malko looks at Tyrion and laughs."
4009,3,5,TYRION,(looks at Jorah) Him.
4010,3,5,MALKO,Him? He’s got to be 60 years old.
4011,3,5,TYRION,"Sure, he’s a bit long in the tooth, a bit withered, been in the sun too long. We can all see that. But he is a veteran of 100 battles. They wrote songs about him! Malko gestures to his men to bring Jorah closer. Malko: Is that true? Jorah nods."
4012,3,5,TYRION,"He won the tournament at Lannisport, unseating Ser Jaime Lannister himself. Malko shakes his head and laughs."
4013,3,5,TYRION,The Kingslayer!
4014,3,5,MALKO,Jousting. You’re talking about jousting. A fancy game for fancy lads. The men who fight at Mereen will swallow him whole.
4015,3,5,JORAH,"I killed a Dothraki blood rider in single combat. Malko jumps up, shocked, and gets in Jorah’s face."
4016,3,5,MALKO,Liar.
4017,3,5,JORAH,"It’s no lie. His name was Qotho. He was bloodrider to Khal Drogo. Take me to Slaver’s Bay, put a sword in my hand, I’ll prove my worth. Malko looks in his eyes, smiles, then nods. EXT. KING’S LANDING - STREETS Littlefinger walks by the Faith Militant."
4018,3,5,LANCEL,Lord Baelish.
4019,3,5,BAELISH,Yes? (Lancel approaches him) Lancel Lannister.
4020,3,5,LANCEL,Brother Lancel. We abandoned our family names.
4021,3,5,BAELISH,That’s quite a family to abandon.
4022,3,5,LANCEL,"The city has changed since you were here last. We flooded the gutters with wine, smashed the false idols, and sent the godless on the run."
4023,3,5,BAELISH,Well done. He tries to walk past Lancel. Lancel puts his hand on Baelish’s shoulder and stops him.
4024,3,5,BAELISH,I’m here on urgent business for the Queen Mother. Should I send word that I’ll be delayed? Lancel lets go.
4025,3,5,LANCEL,"Step carefully, Lord Baelish. You’ll find that there’s little tolerance for flesh peddlers in the new King’s Landing."
4026,3,5,BAELISH,"We both peddle fantasies, Brother Lancel. Mine just happen to be entertaining. INT. CERSEI’S ROOM"
4027,3,5,BAELISH,"Do you think it’s wise, your Grace, arresting the heir to Highgarden?"
4028,3,5,CERSEI,The Faith arrested the heir to Highgarden.
4029,3,5,BAELISH,Of course. And the Faith were armed on your orders.
4030,3,5,CERSEI,The King’s orders. Is the King to blame for Ser Loras’ perversion?
4031,3,5,BAELISH,House Tyrell won’t tolerate these insults.
4032,3,5,CERSEI,"House Tyrell won’t tolerate it? I’m the insulted party, Lord Baelish. Ser Loras was promised to me, instead he chose the company of boys."
4033,3,5,BAELISH,One’s choice of companion is a curious thing. Cersei is silent for a moment.
4034,3,5,CERSEI,Most curious. Lysa Arryn for instance. A sorrily repellent woman. Forgive me. I know you’re still in mourning.
4035,3,5,BAELISH,Lysa was a good woman. A kind woman.
4036,3,5,CERSEI,"She was neither of those things, we both know it. Still, I pity her son. How fortunate that the young Lord of the Vale has a new father to counsel him."
4037,3,5,BAELISH,I know how hard it can be to lose both of your parents at such a young age.
4038,3,5,CERSEI,If war comes to Westeros will the Knights of the Veil fight for their king?
4039,3,5,BAELISH,Young Lord Robyn heeds my advice. And I have always counseled loyalty to the throne.
4040,3,5,CERSEI,Good. ( Cersei gets up ) If there’s nothing else.
4041,3,5,BAELISH,"There is another matter, your Grace. Something so urgent I couldn’t trust the words to a raven. You once charged me with finding Arya Stark. To my shame I failed you. But I have found Sansa Stark. Alive, and well, and home again. In Winterfell."
4042,3,5,CERSEI,That’s not possible.
4043,3,5,BAELISH,"My sources are well placed. They tell me Roose Bolton plans to marry her to his son, Ramsay, a bastard recently legitimized by King Tommen."
4044,3,5,CERSEI,Roose Bolton is Warden of the North by the grace of my father.
4045,3,5,BAELISH,Indeed. As reward for stabbing his own king in the heart.
4046,3,5,CERSEI,We were fools to trust a turncloak.
4047,3,5,BAELISH,Marrying his son to the last of the Starks gives him more legitimacy in the North than an alliance with a hated southern house.
4048,3,5,CERSEI,I will skin him and his bastard like that wretch on that bloody sigil.
4049,3,5,BAELISH,"I would counsel patience, your grace."
4050,3,5,CERSEI,"Patience? Sansa helped murder my son, Roose Bolton is a traitor."
4051,3,5,BAELISH,"Stannis Baratheon is also a traitor, marching with his army on Winterfell. Let Stannis and Roose battle, let the enemies of the throne slaughter each other and when they’re done seize Winterfell from whichever thief survives."
4052,3,5,CERSEI,"Winterfell is 1,000 miles away from here. The weather has already begun to turn."
4053,3,5,BAELISH,"That is why it is critical to strike soon, while the victor still licks his wounds. Surely your Uncle Kevan could muster a force."
4054,3,5,CERSEI,My Uncle Kevan has all the courage of a kitchen mouse.
4055,3,5,BAELISH,"Ser Jaime, then."
4056,3,5,CERSEI,Jaime is away on a sensitive diplomatic mission. I’ve no idea when he’ll be back.
4057,3,5,BAELISH,"Perhaps I can help. The Knights of the Vale are some of the best fighters in Westeros, trained to battle in the ice and the snow."
4058,3,5,CERSEI,"Forgive me Lord Baelish, you have a reputation as a money lender and brothel keeper, not a military man."
4059,3,5,BAELISH,"You wouldn’t risk a single Lannister soldier or a single coin from the Royal Treasury. What do you have to lose, a brothel keeper?"
4060,3,5,CERSEI,And if you succeed?
4061,3,5,BAELISH,Name me Warden of the North.
4062,3,5,CERSEI,I’ll speak to the king this evening. Have him issue a royal decree.
4063,3,5,BAELISH,I’ll not rest until the lion flies over Winterfell.
4064,3,5,CERSEI,And I’ll l know you’re a man of your word when I see Sansa Stark’s head on a spike.
4065,3,5,BAELISH,As I said. I live to serve. EXT. DORNE - GARDEN Trystane puts a flower in Myrcella’s hair.
4066,3,5,TRYSTANE,I’m going to ask him tomorrow.
4067,3,5,MYRCELLA,What if he says no?
4068,3,5,TRYSTANE,He won’t. You’ve waited long enough. I want you to be my wife now. What is it?
4069,3,5,MYRCELLA,"Do you want to marry me because our families arranged it, or do you… Trystane kisses her in the middle of the sentence. Myrcella pushes him off."
4070,3,5,MYRCELLA,We can’t. Not yet.
4071,3,5,TRYSTANE,Why not?
4072,3,5,MYRCELLA,You know why not. Someone will see.
4073,3,5,TRYSTANE,You are going to be my wife. I am going to be your husband. We are allowed to walk through the gardens together.
4074,3,5,MYRCELLA,How many other girls have you walked through these gardens?
4075,3,5,TRYSTANE,I like the way your eyes go squinty when you’re jealous.
4076,3,5,MYRCELLA,"They don’t go squinty, and you didnt answer the question. Cut to Doran and Areo on the balcony."
4077,3,5,DORAN,They make a lovely couple. A Lannister and a Martell. They have no idea how dangerous that is. We must protect them.
4078,3,5,AREO,"Yes, my prince."
4079,3,5,DORAN,You have not had to use that axe of yours in a very long time. I hope you remember how.
4080,3,5,AREO,I remember how. EXT. DORNE - COUNTRYSIDE BRONN (singing): The Dornishman’s wife was as fair as the sun and her kisses were warmer than spring. The Dornishman’s blade it was made of black steel and its kiss was a terrible thing. The Dornishman’s wife would sing as she bathed in a voice that was sweet as a peach...
4081,3,5,JAIME,"Alright, thats enough."
4082,3,5,BRONN,I’m coming to the best part.
4083,3,5,JAIME,We’re trying to blend in. We don’t want everyone in Dorne to hear your accent.
4084,3,5,BRONN,This song really is all about the ending.
4085,3,5,JAIME,It can wait. Up there. He spots a line of Dornishmen walking towards the Water Gardens.
4086,3,5,JAIME,That’s the Water Gardens.
4087,3,5,BRONN,"Once we got the princess, then what?"
4088,3,5,JAIME,I like to improvise.
4089,3,5,BRONN,That explains the golden hand. EXT. DORNE - WATER GARDENS Jaime and Bronn ride in behind common folk carrying meat and other goods. They break off from the pack. INT. SHADOWY ROOM
4090,3,5,ELLARIA,"Unbowed, unbent, unbroken. For Oberyn."
4091,3,5,SNAKES,For Oberyn. They storm towards the Water Gardens as Ellaria watches. EXT. WATER GARDENS Jamie and Bronn converge on Myrcella and Trystane as the Sand Snakes approach. They see the two kissing.
4092,3,5,BRONN,"Well, she’s made herself at home. They walk over."
4093,3,5,JAIME,Myrcella. They stop kissing.
4094,3,5,MYRCELLA,"Uncle Jaime? I don’t understand, what are you doing here?"
4095,3,5,JAIME,Let’s speak in private.
4096,3,5,TRYSTANE,I am Trystane Martell.
4097,3,5,MYRCELLA,Trystane is my intended.
4098,3,5,JAIME,Excellent. Good to meet you. Jaime shakes hands with Trystane with his good hand.
4099,3,5,TRYSTANE,"We weren’t expecting you, Ser Jaime. Bronn advances."
4100,3,5,BRONN,"Why don’t you let them have some time alone, son? Trystane inspects Bronn’s armor, looking for a sigil."
4101,3,5,BRONN,"Let’s not do something stupid. Trystane reaches for his sword and Bronn punches him across the face, knocking him out."
4102,3,5,MYRCELLA,No!
4103,3,5,BRONN,That was something stupid.
4104,3,5,JAIME,"We have to go, Myrcella, now."
4105,3,5,MYRCELLA,You hurt him!
4106,3,5,JAIME,"You’ll be fine, I promise, but we have to-- A whip wraps around Jaime’s wrist. The Sand Snakes are here."
4107,3,5,BRONN,"Oh for fuck’s sake. The Sand Snakes attack Jaime and Bronn, one wielding a spear, one wielding a whip, and one wielding a pair of daggers. They occupy Bronn and Jaime long enough for Obara to get to Myrcella."
4108,3,5,OBARA,You’re coming with me.
4109,3,5,MYRCELLA,I don’t want to!
4110,3,5,OBARA,"I wasn’t asking, princess. Obara starts taking Myrcella out of the gardens. A Sand Snake cuts Bronn’s arm open. Areo and his men meet Obara as she escapes."
4111,3,5,AREO,"Drop you weapons! The rest of Areo’s men surround the Sand Snakes, Bronn, and Jaime."
4112,3,5,OBARA,I am Obara Sand. Daughter of Oberyn Martell. I fight for Dorne. Who do you fight for?
4113,3,5,AREO,"Drop your weapons! The Snakes drop their weapons. Jaime stares down Areo, sword still in hand. Areo puts his axe to Jaime’s neck."
4114,3,5,AREO,"When you were whole, it would have been a good fight. Jaime drops the sword, Areo’s men grab him. Bronn drops his sword. BRONN (to Snake): You fight pretty good for a little girl. She screams at Bronn and is restrained by Areo’s men. They are all escorted away. The rest of Areo’s men corner Elaria in the room outside the Gardens. EXT. THE KINGSROAD A carriage rides on the outskirts of King’s Landing."
4115,3,5,RIDER,Halt! Cut to inside the carriage.
4116,3,5,OLENNA,"Oh! You can smell the shit from 5 miles away. Well, why are we stopped, go on. EXT. KING’S LANDING - GARDEN"
4117,3,5,OLENNA,"Rumors and gossip, that’s all they got. It’s theater, nothing more. If they arrested all the pillow biters in King’s Landing there’d be no room left in the dungeons for anyone else."
4118,3,5,MARGAERY,Everyone knew about him and Renly.
4119,3,5,OLENNA,Renly Baratheon shagged half the stable boys in the Seven Kingdoms. Everyone knew. No one cared.
4120,3,5,MARGAERY,But he was the king’s brother.
4121,3,5,OLENNA,"And Loras is the queen’s brother. No, no, no, no, this is unacceptable."
4122,3,5,MARGAERY,Cersei is behind this.
4123,3,5,OLENNA,"Of course she is. She wants to drag our names through the dirt. Put us in our place. Get some rest, dear, you look appalling. Let me deal with Cersei Lannister. INT. CERSEI’S ROOM Cersei writes at her desk without acknowledging Olenna."
4124,3,5,OLENNA,"Your Grace, I have travelled a long way."
4125,3,5,CERSEI,You must be exhausted.
4126,3,5,OLENNA,"Put the pen down, dear, we all know you aren’t writing anything."
4127,3,5,CERSEI,"Ah, yes, the famously tart-tongued queen of thorns."
4128,3,5,OLENNA,And the famous tart Queen Cersei.
4129,3,5,CERSEI,Beg your pardon.
4130,3,5,OLENNA,I know you’re behind this absurd incarceration of my grandson.
4131,3,5,CERSEI,If you apologize for that comment perhaps--
4132,3,5,OLENNA,You’ll get your apology when I get Loras.
4133,3,5,CERSEI,I was as shocked as anyone when The Faith arrested Ser Loras. I have no love for these fanatics. But what can the queen mother do?
4134,3,5,OLENNA,"Has the crown suddenly stopped needing the troops, gold, and wheat my house supplies?"
4135,3,5,CERSEI,I assure you our alliance with House Tyrell remains--
4136,3,5,OLENNA,Do you expect the alliance to continue after you’ve thrown our future into prison?
4137,3,5,CERSEI,"As I said, i didn’t imprison anyone. As for your veiled threats--"
4138,3,5,OLENNA,What veil?
4139,3,5,CERSEI,The Lannister-Tyrell alliance brought peace to a war-torn country. Do you really want to see the Seven Kingdoms slide back into warfare?
4140,3,5,OLENNA,I didn’t trust your father. I didn’t particularly like him. But I respected him. He was no fool. He understood that sometimes we must work with our rivals rather than destroy them.
4141,3,5,CERSEI,"House Lannister has no rival. The High Septon has called for an inquest, not a trial. Just a small hearing to determine whether the charges against Loras have merit, which I’m sure they don’t. Loras will be freed, our happy alliance will continue, and we’ll forget this unfortunate conversation ever happened. Good day, Lady Olenna. INT. HIGH SEPTON’S ROOM"
4142,3,5,SPARROW,You are aware of the rumors concerning you and Renly?
4143,3,5,LORAS,I don’t pay attention to rumors.
4144,3,5,SPARROW,"You were said to be despondent when he died. Witnesses said that you refused to leave his bedside, even as Stannis’ army closed in"
4145,3,5,LORAS,He was my friend. He was my king.
4146,3,5,SPARROW,"Wasn’t Joffrey your king? He was anointed by the 7, not Renly."
4147,3,5,LORAS,I was wrong to support Renly’s claim. I know that. But I was forgiven by Joffrey. I fought for him at the Battle of the Blackwater.
4148,3,5,SPARROW,Wearing Renly’s armor.
4149,3,5,LORAS,Why does it matter what I wore?
4150,3,5,SPARROW,"Do you deny all of the charges against you? Fornication, buggery, blasphemy."
4151,3,5,LORAS,Of course I deny them.
4152,3,5,SPARROW,You never lay with Renly Baratheon.
4153,3,5,LORAS,Never.
4154,3,5,SPARROW,Nor any other man.
4155,3,5,LORAS,Never.
4156,3,5,SPARROW,That will be all Ser Loras. Loras walks back to his seat.
4157,3,5,OLENNA,Well I think that’s quite enough of that.
4158,3,5,SPARROW,Faith calls Queen Margaery forward.
4159,3,5,MARGAERY,You call me forward?
4160,3,5,SPARROW,Yes. We have some questions for you.
4161,3,5,MARGAERY,I am the queen.
4162,3,5,SPARROW,"You are. And according to Law of the Seven, neither kings nor queens are exempt from testimony at a holy inquest. Margaery walks to the stand."
4163,3,5,SPARROW,How do you respond to these charges against your brother?
4164,3,5,MARGAERY,They are lies.
4165,3,5,SPARROW,All of them?
4166,3,5,MARGAERY,All of them.
4167,3,5,SPARROW,"Queen Margaery, in the presence of the gods, do you swear that your brother is innocent of these charges against him, to the best of your knowledge?"
4168,3,5,MARGAERY,"Yes, I swear it."
4169,3,5,SPARROW,"Thank you, your grace. The Faith brings Olyvar in. Loras looks shocked. Cersei gives a thin smile."
4170,3,5,SPARROW,Do you know this man?
4171,3,5,OLYVAR,"Yes, very well. He is Ser Loras Tyrell, heir to Highgarden."
4172,3,5,SPARROW,How did you come to meet?
4173,3,5,OLYVAR,I squired for him. He took a liking to me. He summoned me to his chamber the first day we met.
4174,3,5,SPARROW,And what occurred in his chamber?
4175,3,5,OLYVAR,We engaged in intimate relations.
4176,3,5,SPARROW,You laid with him?
4177,3,5,OLYVAR,That night and many others.
4178,3,5,LORAS,Liar! He’s a liar!
4179,3,5,SPARROW,Is there anyone else who can support your claim?
4180,3,5,OLYVAR,"Yes, yes, Queen Margaery. She walked in on us once not long ago. She didn’t seem surprised."
4181,3,5,CERSEI,This testimony is an insult to a great house. Why should The Faith or anyone else take the word of a squire over the heir to Highgarden?
4182,3,5,OLYVAR,"He has a birthmark, your grace. Quite high on his thigh, wine-colored, and roughly the shape of Dorne. Loras jumps at Olyvar and The Faith restrains him. Margaery and Olenna get up to leave and The Faith blocks their way."
4183,3,5,LORAS,Liar!
4184,3,5,OLENNA,What are you doing? Let us pass.
4185,3,5,SPARROW,The Faith is satisfied that there is enough evidence to bring a formal trial for Ser Loras... and Queen Margaery.
4186,3,5,MARGAERY,What?
4187,3,5,SPARROW,Bearing false witness before the gods is as grave a sin as any. Take her. The Faith grabs her and carries her out of the room.
4188,3,5,MARGAERY,"Tommen! Tommen! King Tommen looks around the room, unsure of what to do."
4189,3,5,MARGAERY,"You can’t do this, I am the queen! Tommen, Tommen! I am your queen, how dare you! Olenna glares at Cersei. Cersei smiles back. INT. WINTERFELL - SANSA’S CHAMBER Sansa looks at herself in the mirror. She hears a knock and opens the door. It's Myranda."
4190,3,5,SANSA,What do you want?
4191,3,5,MYRANDA,"Lord Ramsay sent me to draw your bath, my lady. You want to be clean and fresh for your new husband don’t you? Cut to Sansa in the bath. Myranda washes the black dye out of Sansa’s hair."
4192,3,5,MYRANDA,"You’re so beautiful. But if you need to keep him happy. Ramsay gets bored easily. You dont want to end up like... Well, like the others."
4193,3,5,SANSA,What others?
4194,3,5,MYRANDA,I shouldn’t gossip. It’s good to see the red again. No point in hiding anymore.
4195,3,5,SANSA,What others?
4196,3,5,MYRANDA,"Let’s see. There was Kiera. The blacksmith’s daughter. She was tall. Like you. Lovely figure. But she talked and talked and talked and… Ramsay got tired of that. Then there was Violet. She had gorgeous blond hair. But she got pregnant and, well, that was boring. Then Tamsay. Such a sweet girl. Of course sweet girls get a bit dull after a while, don’t they? Ramsay let me come with him on that hunt."
4197,3,5,SANSA,Hunt?
4198,3,5,MYRANDA,"Mm. Have you ever seen a body after the dogs have been at it? Not so pretty. But it’s your wedding day, why am I talking about such things?"
4199,3,5,SANSA,What was your name again?
4200,3,5,MYRANDA,Myranda.
4201,3,5,SANSA,"And how long have you loved him, Myranda. Did you imagine that he would be with you forever, is that it? Then I came along and ruined it. I am Sansa Stark of Winterfell. This is my home and you can’t frighten me."
4202,3,5,MYRANDA,"Are you done with your bath, my lady?"
4203,3,5,SANSA,Go. I can finish on my own. EXT. SANSA’S ROOM - MORNING Snow falls outside. There is a knock on the door.
4204,3,5,SANSA,Yes? INT. SANSA’S ROOM Theon enters.
4205,3,5,THEON,"I’ve come to escort you to the Godswood, my lady. If you please, my lady, will you take my arm?"
4206,3,5,SANSA,No.
4207,3,5,THEON,"Lord Ramsay, he said I'm to take your arm."
4208,3,5,SANSA,I’m not touching you.
4209,3,5,THEON,Please. He’ll punish me.
4210,3,5,SANSA,Do you think I care what he does to you. Sansa leaves the room without Theon. EXT. THE GODSWOOD Sansa walks to the Godswood with Theon. Ramsay is waiting alongside his father and with the Bolton men forming an aisle. Roose walks forward.
4211,3,5,ROOSE,Who comes before the Old Gods this night?
4212,3,5,THEON,"Sansa of the House Stark comes here to be wed. A woman grown, trueborn and noble. She comes to beg the blessings of the gods. Who comes to claim her? Ramsay steps forward."
4213,3,5,RAMSAY,Ramsay of House Bolton. Heir to the Dreadfort and Winterfell. Who gives her?
4214,3,5,THEON,Theon of House Greyjoy. Who was… who was her father’s ward.
4215,3,5,ROOSE,"Lady Sansa, will you take this man? Long pause. Cut to Ramsay, Walda, and Myranda. Sansa steps forward."
4216,3,5,SANSA,I take this man. Ramsay smiles. INT. RAMSAY’S CHAMBERS Theon opens the door for Ramsay and Sansa.
4217,3,5,RAMSAY,Are you pleased my lady? Sansa nods.
4218,3,5,RAMSAY,Good. I want you to be happy. My father said you’re still a virgin.
4219,3,5,SANSA,Yes.
4220,3,5,RAMSAY,Why? Why are you still a virgin? Afraid of dwarves?
4221,3,5,SANSA,"Lord Tyrion was kind, he was gentle, he never touched me."
4222,3,5,RAMSAY,You’re not lying to me?
4223,3,5,SANSA,"No, my lord."
4224,3,5,RAMSAY,"Lying to your husband on his wedding night, that would be a very bad way to start a marriage. We are man and wife now, we should be honest with each other, don’t you think?"
4225,3,5,SANSA,Yes sir. Ramsay kisses her.
4226,3,5,RAMSAY,Good. Now take off your clothes. Theon starts to leave.
4227,3,5,RAMSAY,"Oh, no no no. You stay here Reek. You watch. (to Sansa) Do I need to ask a second time? I hate asking a second time. Sansa starts to undo her coat. Theon closes the door."
4228,3,5,RAMSAY,Reek? I told you to watch. Theon looks up.
4229,3,6,DEFAULT,"The Gift Script Lyrics EXT. CASTLE BLACK Men of the Night’s Watch prepare the horses as snow falls on Castle Black. Thormund is brought before Jon. Jon looks at him, nods, and  a Brother removes Tormund’s chains. Thormund raises his free hands to Ser Alliser in the distance and is carried away. Jon walks over to Alliser."
4230,3,6,JON,"First Ranger, you have command of Castle Black."
4231,3,6,ALLISER,"Lord Commander, it is my duty to tell you I believe this mission to be reckless, foolhardy, and an insult to all of the Brothers that have died fighting the wildlings. Cut to Olly watching their conversation from afar."
4232,3,6,JON,"As always, thank you for your honesty. Jon walks away to Sam."
4233,3,6,SAM,"Safe travels, Lord Commander."
4234,3,6,JON,"Thank you, Sam."
4235,3,6,SAM,"Oh, and… Sam hands him a wrapped package. Jon opens it to find a sword."
4236,3,6,SAM,It’s Dragonglass. It’s what I used to kill the White Walker. I hope you don’t need them.
4237,3,6,JON,Me too. They hug. Jon gets on a horse next to Tormund and rides away. INT. CASTLE BLACK - MAESTOR AEMON’S ROOM
4238,3,6,AEMON,"There he is. That laugh. Egg! Egg laughed like that. One of the first things I remember about him. Gilly looks at Sam, confused."
4239,3,6,SAM,"His little brother, Aegon. He became king."
4240,3,6,AEMON,"And before that, he was a jolly fellow. Like this one. Aemon’s mood changes, he suddenly becomes panicked."
4241,3,6,AEMON,"Get him south, Gillyflower. Before it’s too late. INT. WINTERFELL - HALLWAY Theon carries a food plate across the hall. He arrives at a door and unlocks it. INT. SANSA’S ROOM Sansa is sleeping. Theon approaches and closes a window, waking Sansa."
4242,3,6,SANSA,"Theon, wait."
4243,3,6,THEON,"Not Theon, my lady. Reek. Sansa sits up in bed, revealing cuts and bruises along her arms."
4244,3,6,SANSA,Help me.
4245,3,6,THEON,You’re his wife now.
4246,3,6,SANSA,Theon
4247,3,6,THEON,Do what he says. Do what he says or he’ll hurt you.
4248,3,6,SANSA,He already hurts me every night. All day I’m locked in this room and every night he comes. It can’t be worse.
4249,3,6,THEON,It can. It can always be worse. Sansa stands up.
4250,3,6,SANSA,What did he do to you?
4251,3,6,THEON,Please… Theon goes for the door. Sansa runs to the door and blocks him from leaving.
4252,3,6,SANSA,You betrayed my family!
4253,3,6,THEON,I’m sorry. I’m sorry!
4254,3,6,SANSA,You have to help me!
4255,3,6,THEON,He’ll see us. You don’t know him.
4256,3,6,SANSA,"My family still has friends in the North. All I have to do is give a signal and they’ll rescue me. Climb to the top of the Broken Tower, light this candle, and put it in the window. Promise me, Theon."
4257,3,6,THEON,"Reek, my lady, Reek!"
4258,3,6,SANSA,"Your name is Theon Greyjoy. Last surviving son of Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands, do you hear me? Theon. Promise me. Theon hesitates, nods, and exits the room. EXT. WINTERFELL Theon walks across Winterfell with the Broken Tower in the background. INT. WINTERFELL - BROKEN TOWER Theon climbs the stairs to the top floor. He opens the door to see Ramsay eating."
4259,3,6,RAMSAY,"Yes, Reek? EXT. OUTSIDE WINTERFELL Brienne stares at the top floor of the Broken Tower from beyond the walls of Winterfell. INT. CASTLE BLACK - AEMON’S ROOM Close-up on a candle, then Gilly’s baby."
4260,3,6,AEMON,Egg! Egg! Mothers looking for you! Egg!
4261,3,6,GILLY,"Get some sleep, Sam. You’ll have to speak for him tomorrow."
4262,3,6,SAM,You don’t know that.
4263,3,6,GILLY,Get some sleep. I’ll watch over him.
4264,3,6,SAM,I’ll stay too. He’s always been good to me. I can’t leave him now. AEMON (panicked): Egg! Egg.. I dreamed... that I was old EXT. CASTLE BLACK Close up on Maester Aemon’s funeral pyre.
4265,3,6,SAM,"His name was Aemon Targaryen. He came to us from King’s Landing, a Maester of the Citadel, chained and sworn. And a sworn brother of the Night’s Watch, ever faithful. No man was wiser or gentler or kinder. At the Wall a dozen Lord Commanders came and went during his years of service, but he was always there to counsel them. He was the blood of the dragon, but now his fire has gone out. And now his watch has ended."
4266,3,6,BROTHERS,"And now his watch has ended. Sam lights the pyre, then hands the torch to Alliser, who lights it then passes it along."
4267,3,6,ALLISER,"You’re losing all your friends, Tarly. Sam looks up to see a Brother glaring at him. EXT. WINTERFELL Sansa walks up to Ramsay."
4268,3,6,RAMSAY,My beautiful wife. He kisses her.
4269,3,6,RAMSAY,"When my father told me we were marrying I half expected a fat, bearded beast. Do you know how pleased I was when I saw you? You’ve made me very happy. They start walking down stairs. Sansa grabs a cross in the snow before they leave."
4270,3,6,RAMSAY,"Our scouts report that Stannis Baratheon rides for Winterfell. He’s a respected commander. His troops are loyal and battle tested. He’s hired thousands of foreign sell swords to bolster his army. But this storm was a stroke of luck for us northerners. Our people are used to fighting in frost. His army’s out there now, suffering in the snow. One day I’ll be Lord of Winterfell, and Warden of the North. You’ll be my Lady and Wardeness."
4271,3,6,SANSA,But isn’t your step mother pregnant?
4272,3,6,RAMSAY,What of it?
4273,3,6,SANSA,What happens if she has a boy?
4274,3,6,RAMSAY,Then I’ll have a baby brother.
4275,3,6,SANSA,But he’ll be the heir.
4276,3,6,RAMSAY,I’m Lord Bolton’s eldest son.
4277,3,6,SANSA,"But you’re a bastard, a true born will always have the stronger claim. Ramsay stops walking."
4278,3,6,RAMSAY,I’ve been naturalized by a royal decree of--
4279,3,6,SANSA,Tommen Baratheon. Another bastard. They start walking again.
4280,3,6,RAMSAY,"Bastards can rise high in the world. Like your half-brother Jon Snow. Born The Bastard of Winterfell, now the Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch. Sansa looks shocked."
4281,3,6,RAMSAY,"You didn’t know? Yes, he’s done very well for himself. Ah. I near forgot why I asked you to join me. Come, my lady. EXT. WINTERFELL The woman who visited Sansa’s chamber previously is out in the open, flayed to death."
4282,3,6,RAMSAY,Your Northern friend. Reek told me you wanted to leave. Cut to Theon looking terrified.
4283,3,6,RAMSAY,"Why? Winterfell is your home and I am your husband. Sansa continues to look at the woman, horrified."
4284,3,6,RAMSAY,"Tough old bird. Everyone talks when I start beating them. But this one. Her heart gave out before I got to her face. We do breed them tough in the North. Bring my wife back to her chamber. It’s far too cold out here for a lady. You should hold on to your candles. The nights are so long now. He kisses her on the cheek then she is carried away. EXT. STANNIS’ CAMP D avo s rides through the camp on horseback, observing the men as they cough and huddle around each other. The snow is falling hard. INT. STANNIS’ CAMP - STANNIS’ TENT"
4285,3,6,DAVOS,40 horses died in the night. We’ll lose more come sunset. We’re running out of food. We can’t open the supply line until the snow clears.
4286,3,6,STANNIS,What else?
4287,3,6,DAVOS,The Stormcrows rode off last night.
4288,3,6,STANNIS,500 men. Davos nods. Stannis removes a Baratheon piece from his chess board.
4289,3,6,STANNIS,"Sell swords, loyal to nothing but gold."
4290,3,6,DAVOS,We still have a hard march to Wintefell and we won’t be marching anywhere in this weather.
4291,3,6,STANNIS,And?
4292,3,6,DAVOS,"This isn’t our time, we should head back to Castle Black when the snow clears."
4293,3,6,STANNIS,"I retreated from King’s Landing, Ser Davos. If I retreat again, I become “The King Who Ran.”"
4294,3,6,DAVOS,Your Grace..
4295,3,6,STANNIS,"Winter is coming. Those arent just the Stark words, it’s a fact. If we march back to Castle Black, we winter at Castle Black. And who can say how many years this winter will last."
4296,3,6,DAVOS,It’s better to wait for the right time than to risk everything.
4297,3,6,STANNIS,"This is the right time, and I will risk everything. Because if I don't, we’ve lost. We march to victory or we march to defeat, but we go forward only forward, Davos looks to Melisandre, lurking in the back of the tent."
4298,3,6,DAVOS,"Your Grace. (leaves) STANNIS (to Melisandre): I’ve trusted in your visions, in your prophecies for years."
4299,3,6,MELISANDRE,"You saw it yourself, my king, when you stared into the flames. A great battle in the snow."
4300,3,6,STANNIS,I don’t know what I saw.
4301,3,6,MELISANDRE,You do know. Trust yourself.
4302,3,6,STANNIS,"And you, do you trust yourself?"
4303,3,6,MELISANDRE,I trust in the Lord.
4304,3,6,STANNIS,Are you sure?
4305,3,6,MELISANDRE,I have seen myself walk along the battlements of Wintefell. I have seen the flayed men banners lowered to the ground. She flips the Bolton pieces over on Stannis’ board.
4306,3,6,MELISANDRE,But sometimes sacrifices must be made to ensure victory. I have shown you the power of king's blood. The Usurper Robb Stark. The Usurper Joffrey Baratheon.
4307,3,6,STANNIS,We don’t have Robert’s bastard here.
4308,3,6,MELISANDRE,"No, we have someone better, and your blood runs through her veins."
4309,3,6,STANNIS,Have you lost your mind?
4310,3,6,MELISANDRE,Do you doubt me still? After all that you’ve seen?
4311,3,6,STANNIS,There must be another way. Leeches or something.
4312,3,6,MELISANDRE,There is only one way. You must become king before the Long Night begins. Only you can lead the living against the dead. All your life has led us to this moment. To this decision.
4313,3,6,STANNIS,She’s my daughter. Melisandre embraces him.
4314,3,6,STANNIS,Get out. INT. CASTLE BLACK - WASH ROOM Gilly washes clothes. Two Brothers walk into the room.
4315,3,6,DERRYK,The beauty from beyond The Wall. Gilly starts walking away.
4316,3,6,BRAND,"Where are you going, huh? Aren’t we better looking than the fat man?"
4317,3,6,DERRYK,"The question is, is she pretty down south in the real world, or is she pretty because she’s the only girl here?"
4318,3,6,BRAND,"Even in White Harbor, I’d want a kiss."
4319,3,6,DERRYK,"Come on love, give us a kiss."
4320,3,6,GILLY,Leave me alone.
4321,3,6,DERRYK,If you were my girl I wouldn’t leave you alone.
4322,3,6,BRAND,One little kiss.
4323,3,6,DERRYK,"Come on, give him a kiss."
4324,3,6,BRAND,A man gets lonely guarding the Wall. She tries to walk away. They slap the laundry basket out of her hands and trap her.
4325,3,6,BRAND,There’s no need to be rude.
4326,3,6,DERRYK,We just want a little affection. She slaps Derryk across the face. Sam enters the room and pulls out his sword.
4327,3,6,SAM,Get your hands off her. Brother Derryk. Brother Brand. I believe you both have guard duty tonight.
4328,3,6,BRAND,Sam the Slayer. Are you gonna slay me with that sword?
4329,3,6,DERRYK,Look at his hands shaking.
4330,3,6,SAM,"Gilly go on, Get back to your room and lock the door. Derryk throws her to the floor."
4331,3,6,SAM,I’m warning you.
4332,3,6,DERRYK,Come on! Come on! Sam swings the sword. It is deflected and he is subdued. Derryk punches him in the gut then starts kicking him.
4333,3,6,DERRYK,"You lying sack of shit! Killed a White Walker, eh? You fatass fuck. Come on, get up. (to Gilly) He’s your hero. He’s a hog!"
4334,3,6,GILLY,Leave him alone! She charges at Derryk. He subdues her.
4335,3,6,DERRYK,Stubborn little wilding bitch aren’t ya? Brand kicks Sam in the face.
4336,3,6,GILLY,Sam! Sam! Sam! He punches Sam repeatedly in the face until he seems to lose consciousness.
4337,3,6,BRAND,Alright. Hold still. They both hold Gilly down as she screams. Sam gets back up.
4338,3,6,SAM,I said get your hands off her.
4339,3,6,BRAND,You’re gonna get yourself killed.
4340,3,6,DERRYK,Roll over. Jon Snow’s not here to save you.
4341,3,6,SAM,I killed a White Walker. I killed a Thenn. I’ll take my chances with you. Ghost shows up and growls at the brothers. They sprint out of the room. Sam falls to his knees.
4342,3,6,GILLY,Sam!
4343,3,6,SAM,I’m alright.
4344,3,6,GILLY,You’re not.
4345,3,6,SAMMY,Just a bit woozy. Sam collapses onto his side. INT. CASTLE BLACK - BEDROOM Gilly washes out Sam’s wounds with a wash cloth.
4346,3,6,GILLY,The next time you see something like that you leave it alone.
4347,3,6,SAM,I will not. They would’ve… I don’t know what they would have done
4348,3,6,GILLY,I know they would have killed you if Ghost hadn’t come.
4349,3,6,SAM,No. They were tiring out. I had them in the palm of my hand.
4350,3,6,GILLY,"Don’t be stupid Sam, you’re not a fighter."
4351,3,6,SAM,What kind of man would I be if I ran away when I saw someone hurting you?
4352,3,6,GILLY,Just promise me that whatever happens you’ll take care of little Sam.
4353,3,6,SAM,"Of course I will. And I’ll take care of you, too."
4354,3,6,GILLY,I need more water. She gets up. Sam grabs her arm.
4355,3,6,SAM,"Stay. Please. Gilly gets on top of Sam and starts kissing him. She gets back up, and puts her hands around his neck and starts kissing him again."
4356,3,6,GILLY,Am I hurting you? He shakes his head no.
4357,3,6,GILLY,"Are you sure? Sam nods yes. She pulls his pants down, pulls her dress up, and starts riding him."
4358,3,6,SAM,Oh. Oh my. EXT. VOLANTIS - SLAVER’S AUCTION The slaves are carried up to the auction stage. One of Malko’s men whips Tyrion.
4359,3,6,MALKO,"A rare find for the fighting pits, my friends. Not your usual street tough old drunken pirate. This one’s a Westerosi knight from an ancient house, trained in sword and lance. he fought beside the Stag King Robert on the far side of the Narrow Sea. He was first from the breach during the siege of Pyke, slaughtering 50 men with his flaming sword. He killed the great Khal Drogo in single combat. Betrayed by his woman, he sold himself into slavery to repay his debts. Bidding begins at 12 gold honors. A hand goes up."
4360,3,6,MALKO,13. Do I have 14? A hand goes up.
4361,3,6,MALKO,15? 15 golds honors. Do I have 16? A man in the front who has been studying Jorah intently raises his hand.
4362,3,6,BUYER,20.
4363,3,6,MALKO,Sold! Jorah is taken away.
4364,3,6,TYRION,Wait! You have to buy me as well.
4365,3,6,BUYER,Why?
4366,3,6,TYRION,"We’re a team. I’m a great fighter, too. The crowd laughs."
4367,3,6,MALKO,"He’s funny. You have to give him that. The man holding Tyrion’s chains laughs at him. Tyrion yanks his chains, pulling the man to the ground, and starts beating on him with the chains as the crowd roars. Tyrion kicks him in the head then looks to the buyer."
4368,3,6,BUYER,Alright. He’s funny. He hands Malko coins.
4369,3,6,TYRION,Thank you my Lord. Thank you.
4370,3,6,BUYER,Yes.
4371,3,6,TYRION,"My Lord, if I may. I’ve heard Mereen’s become a free city. You might run into trouble if you try to fight slaves in the fighting pits. Now if you were to fight free men who were paid a wage… The buyer hits Tyrion in the mouth then tosses him a few coins."
4372,3,6,BUER,"Here’s your wages, funny man. It’ll last the rest of your life. INT. MEREEN - DAENERYS’ CHAMBER"
4373,3,6,DAARIO,How long before the king of Mereen comes to claim my pillow?
4374,3,6,DAENERYS,Don’t be ridiculous. My marriage to Hizdahr is political. I think he’s smart enough to understand that.
4375,3,6,DAARIO,I think the Sons of the Harpy have stopped killing because their leader was made king.
4376,3,6,DAENERYS,Are you jealous?
4377,3,6,DAARIO,Do you think I’m petty enough to speak ill of a man just because he represents competition?
4378,3,6,DAENERYS,I do. Daario laughs.
4379,3,6,DAARIO,You’re right. My motivations are entirely impure. They start kissing.
4380,3,6,DAARIO,Doesn’t make me wrong.
4381,3,6,DAENERYS,"You told me yourself, I can’t fight enemies within and without. So when enemies from without come knocking, I need the city of Mereen behind me. I have no choice."
4382,3,6,DAARIO,Everyone has a choice. Even slaves have a choice. Death or slavery.
4383,3,6,DAENERYS,So what else can I do?
4384,3,6,DAARIO,Marry me instead.
4385,3,6,DAENERYS,"Even if I wanted to do such an inadviseable thing, I couldn’t."
4386,3,6,DAARIO,"Why not? You’re our queen, you can do as you like."
4387,3,6,DAENERYS,No. I can’t
4388,3,6,DAARIO,Then you are the only person in Mereen who’s not free. Daenerys sits up in bed.
4389,3,6,DAARIO,"I know I’m here to serve my queen and not to give advice, but can I make one more suggestion?"
4390,3,6,DAENERYS,Of course
4391,3,6,DAARIO,"On the day of the Great Games, gather all the great masters, and wise masters, and worthy masters you can find, and slaughter them all."
4392,3,6,DAENERYS,I am a queen. Not a butcher.
4393,3,6,DAARIO,All rulers are either butchers or meat. INT. KING’S LANDING - GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR
4394,3,6,OLENNA,"You there! Where would I find the High Septon, or High Sparrow, or whatever bloody fool name he’s got."
4395,3,6,SPARROW,"It’s not as good a name as Queen of Thorns, I’ll admit."
4396,3,6,OLENNA,You should have the decency to stand when you talk to a lady.
4397,3,6,SPARROW,You should have the decency to kneel before the gods
4398,3,6,OLENNA,Don’t spar with me little fellow. The High Septon gets up.
4399,3,6,SPARROW,"For me, it’s the knees. You?"
4400,3,6,OLENNA,Hips.
4401,3,6,SPARROW,Huh.
4402,3,6,OLENNA,"A man of the people, is that your game? It’s an old game. dull and unconvincing. A man of the people who does Cersei’s dirty work for her."
4403,3,6,SPARROW,The people always do the dirty work.
4404,3,6,OLENNA,"Spare me the homilies, I can smell a fraud from a mile away."
4405,3,6,SPARROW,A useful talent.
4406,3,6,OLENNA,I’m here for my grandson and granddaughter.
4407,3,6,SPARROW,"Your grandson and granddaughter swore sacred vows and lied. The Father judges us all. Sons of high lords, sons of fishermen. If you break his laws you will be punished. The High Sparrow heads for the door."
4408,3,6,OLENNA,Don’t you walk away from me.
4409,3,6,SPARROW,"You don’t give commands here, Lady Olenna."
4410,3,6,OLENNA,What is it you want? Gold? I’ll make you the richest septon who ever lived. The High Sparrow laughs.
4411,3,6,OLENNA,What then?
4412,3,6,SPARROW,"I imagine this is strange for you. Everyone you meet has a hidden motive, and you pride yourself on slitting in and out. But I’m telling you a simple truth: I serve the gods. The gods demand justice."
4413,3,6,OLENNA,How do they communicate their demands? By raven or horse?
4414,3,6,SPARROW,By the holy text. The seven pointed star. If you don’t have one in your library I’ll give you my own. OLENNA (with contempt): I’ve read the seven pointed star.
4415,3,6,SPARROW,Then you’ll remember the passages concerning buggery and perjury. Your grandchildren will be punished in the same manner as anyone who breaks the sacred laws.
4416,3,6,OLENNA,"Half the men, women, and children in this foul city break the sacred laws. You live among murderers, thieves, and rapists. And yet you punish Loras for shagging and Margaery for defending her brother?"
4417,3,6,SPARROW,Yes. The Gods’ laws must be applied to all equally.
4418,3,6,OLENNA,"If it’s equality you want then so be it. When House Tyrell stops sending our crops to the capital, everyone here will starve. And I’ll make sure the hungry know who to blame,"
4419,3,6,SPARROW,"Have you ever served the field, Lady Olenna? Have you ever reaped the grain? Has anyone in House Tyrell? A lifetime of wealth and power has left you blind in one eye. You are the few. We are the many. And when the many stop fearing the few… He walks out of the room. EXT. SEPT OF BAELOR"
4420,3,6,SQUIRE,Lady Olenna. He hands her a letter with Baelish's mockingbird sigil. INT. KING’S LANDING - DINING ROOM
4421,3,6,CERSEI,"Starving yourself won't make things any better for her, my love."
4422,3,6,TOMMEN,She’s in a prison cell and there’s nothing I can do. I am the king! The queen is in prison and there’s nothing I can do! Tommen walks to the window. Cersei joins him.
4423,3,6,CERSEI,"No matter who you are, no matter how strong you are, sooner or later, you'll face circumstances beyond your control. Events you couldn't possibly have anticipated or prevented even if you had. You cannot blame yourself for fate. Your father, your brother, your grandfather-- I was Queen of the Seven Kingdoms and what could I do? Hold them as they left this world. Kissed their heads after they'd gone."
4424,3,6,TOMMEN,I’ll call in the army. I’ll take back the sept and kill every last one of them. I’ll start a war if I have to.
4425,3,6,CERSEI,You know as well as I do who the first casualty in that war would be.
4426,3,6,TOMMEN,I love her. I love her. I can’t help her.
4427,3,6,CERSEI,We must be strong for those we love. We cannot give in to despair.
4428,3,6,TOMMEN,I will speak to the high sparrow. There must be something--
4429,3,6,CERSEI,Let me speak to him on your behalf. The king cannot dirty sully himself negotiating with an unwashed fanatic.
4430,3,6,CERSEI,Your happiness is all I want in this world
4431,3,6,TOMMEN,I know.
4432,3,6,CERSEI,"No you don’t. You can’t possibly. Not until you have children of your own. I would do anything for you. Anything to keep you from harm. I would burn cities to the ground. That is all that matters. You and your sister. From the moment you came into this world, my boy. My only boy. Cersei embraces him and starts crying. INT. DORNE Jaime is being kept in a closely monitored room."
4433,3,6,AREO,Prince Doran hopes this satisfies your concerns about the princess’s wellbeing. Areo brings Myrcella into the room.
4434,3,6,MYRCELLA,You looked different when I left. You had more hair.
4435,3,6,JAIME,And more hands. How’s Trystane?
4436,3,6,MYRCELLA,He’ll be alright.
4437,3,6,JAIME,I’m sorry for that. It wasn’t supposed to happen that way.
4438,3,6,MYRCELLA,Why is it happening at all?
4439,3,6,JAIME,Your mother’s worried about you. Threats have been made. Dorne is too dangerous for you. I’ve come to take you home.
4440,3,6,MYRCELLA,"This is my home, this has been my home for years. I didn’t want to come here but she told me to. I did what she said, I did my duty and now she’s forcing me to go back?"
4441,3,6,JAIME,It's for your own good. These are complicated matters.
4442,3,6,MYRCELLA,"It’s not complicated at all, it’s simple. I love Trystane, I’m going to marry him, and we’re staying right here."
4443,3,6,JAIME,I don’t understand.
4444,3,6,MYRCELLA,"Of course you don’t! You don’t know me! Myrcella leaves the room. INT. DORNE - CELL BRONN (singing): Brothers oh brothers, my days here are done, the Dornishman’s taken my life. Bur what does it matter, for all men must die, and I’ve tasted the Dornishman’s wife! Yes I’ve tasted the Dornishman’s wife! In the adjacent cell to Bronn, Tyene claps as the other Snakes glare at her."
4445,3,6,TYENE,He’s got a good voice.
4446,3,6,OBARA,We’re lucky he’s a singer. If he were a fighter we might have been in trouble.
4447,3,6,BRONN,It’s against my code to hurt a woman.
4448,3,6,OBARA,It’s amazing how many men we beat seem to have this code.
4449,3,6,BRONN,I wouldn’t say you beat me.
4450,3,6,TYENE,How’s your arm?
4451,3,6,BRONN,Wonderful. Wouldn’t feel right to leave Dorne without a new scar.
4452,3,6,TYENE,You think you’re leaving Dorne?
4453,3,6,BRONN,No great hurry. Dornish women are the most beautiful women in the world.
4454,3,6,TYENE,Thank you.
4455,3,6,BRONN,I said Dornish women. I didn’t say you.
4456,3,6,TYENE,I’m not the most beautiful woman you’ve ever seen?
4457,3,6,BRONN,I’ve seen quite a few women in all the Seven Kingdoms.
4458,3,6,TYENE,Name one more beautiful than I am.
4459,3,6,BRONN,"Well now, in King’s Landing there was an absolutely gorgeous... Tyene takes one of her breasts out of her tunic."
4460,3,6,TYENE,There was a what? In King’s Landing you were saying.
4461,3,6,BRONN,Was I?
4462,3,6,TYENE,There was a woman more beautiful than I am. Tyene takes both her breasts out.
4463,3,6,BRONN,Was there? My memory’s not what it was earlier.
4464,3,6,TYENE,How’s your arm now?
4465,3,6,BRONN,You seem concerned with it. You must really like me. Tyene undoes the rest of her tunic.
4466,3,6,TYENE,And how about your head?
4467,3,6,BRONN,"My head… You don’t even wanna know what’s going on in… As Bronn scans her naked body, his vision starts to blur and he collapses to the ground."
4468,3,6,TYENE,Your nose is bleeding.
4469,3,6,BRONN,It’s nothing. It’s the dry air.
4470,3,6,TYENE,"My dagger was coated with a special ointment from Asshei. They call it the Long Farewell. It takes time to work, but if a single drop makes contact with the skin, death. She holds a tiny blue cap up to Bronn from her cell."
4471,3,6,TYENE,The only antidote. Who’s the most beautiful woman in the world? Bronn gasps for breath.
4472,3,6,TYENE,Sorry? Who? BRONN (finally): You.
4473,3,6,TYENE,Don’t drop it. Tyene tosses it into his cell and Bronn downs it.
4474,3,6,TYENE,"I think you’re very handsome as well. INT. KING’S LANDING - BAELISH’S BROTHEL Littlefinger peers at the Great Sept of Baelor through the window. The brothel is destroyed, with many seven-pointed stars scribbled on the floor, walls, and artwork."
4475,3,6,BAELISH,I’m sorry about the locale.
4476,3,6,OLENNA,No you’re not.
4477,3,6,BAELISH,It felt like the safest place.
4478,3,6,OLENNA,"Not for your clientele, clearly."
4479,3,6,BAELISH,"It was an establishment like no other. The sheer range of appetites catered to, desires that didn’t exist until we invented them."
4480,3,6,OLENNA,"You’ve always been rather impressed with yourself, haven’t you?"
4481,3,6,BAELISH,The past is the past. The future is all that’s worth discussing. The future of House Tyrell.
4482,3,6,OLENNA,"Don’t pretend to have any concern for my house, my grandchildren, or me. I should have known you’d return to the capital once things started going wrong."
4483,3,6,BAELISH,I promise you..
4484,3,6,OLENNA,"I promise you, Lord Baelish, that our fates are joined. Together we murdered a king. And if my house should fall, I would have nothing to hide. And if i should meet with some accident here at this broken little flesh market, they’ll never even find what’s left of you. So do you deny a part in all of this?"
4485,3,6,BAELISH,Cersei summoned me to King’s Landing. I dared not refuse her.
4486,3,6,OLENNA,And what did she want?
4487,3,6,BAELISH,"A piece of info that she know that I had. Neither silence nor lies were an option. But I have other information of which she is unaware. And as you say, our interests are aligned. I have a gift for you."
4488,3,6,OLENNA,What kind of gift?
4489,3,6,BAELISH,The same kind I gave Cersei. A handsome young man. INT. MEREEN - FIGHTING PITS - WAITING AREA Gladiators prepare their swords and armor.
4490,3,6,OWNER,"Many worthy fighters have died trying to make it to the Great Games. When most of you worthless scum join them in death this afternoon it will represent a significant rise in your station. But if you happen to triumph here you will fight at the great pit of Daznak itself in front of the queen. So whatever happens, the gods have smiled upon you today. Today is the day your lives actually start to mean something. Close-up on Jorah. OWNER (O.S.): You and you, you, you two, you, you, and you. Jorah is not one of the gladiators selected."

4493,3,6,OWNER,Prepare yourselves. EXT. FIGHTING PIT
4494,3,6,DAENERYS,Sitting through the great games will be bad enough.
4495,3,6,HIZDAHR,"For generations, in the days leading up to the great games, it has been customary for our ruler to make the rounds to the lower pits to pay the fighters there the honor of her presence. The fighters enter the pit."
4496,3,6,OWNER,Move yourselves! The slave owner sees Daenerys and runs in front of her and Hizdahr.
4497,3,6,OWNER,"Your Grace. Your Future Grace. You honor us all. The owner gets all his gladiators to face Dany, whispering instructions to them."
4498,3,6,OWNER,"“We fight and die for your glory, O glorious queen.”"
4499,3,6,MEN,"“We fight and die for your glory, O glorious queen.” The fight begins INT. FIGHTING PIT - WAITING AREA Jorah hears “O glorious queen” and runs to the edge of the pit. He sees Daenerys through the grated entrance to the ring. EXT. FIGHTING PIT One bald gladiator dominates the pit. He slits one fighter’s throat, and slices another fighter’s leg as he runs away."
4500,3,6,DAENERYS,I think I’ve seen enough.
4501,3,6,HIZDAHR,"Your Grace, it’s a tradition for the queen to stay until the victor has emerged."
4502,3,6,DAENERYS,I’ve sacrificed more than enough for your traditions. INT. FIGHTING PIT - WAITING AREA Jorah straps a helmet on.
4503,3,6,TYRION,"What are you doing? EXT. FIGHTING PIT Jorah rushes the pit. His owner tries to stop him but he knocks him out with the butt of his sword. Jorah takes out the bald man as he was smashing a man’s head in with a rock. Daenerys takes notice of the fighter but can’t see his face. INT. FIGHTING PIT - WAITING AREA The other gladiators that weren’t chosen to fight follow Jorah’s lead and enter the ring. Tyrion tries but is chained up. He starts sawing at his chain. EXT. FIGHTING PIT Jorah melees a fighter with a shield, then knocks another out with his own helmet. INT. FIGHTING PIT - WAITING AREA A giant man sees Tyrion sawing at his chains. He raises a giant sword above Tyrion’s head, but comes down on the chain, freeing Tyrion. Tyrion nods in thanks. EXT. FIGHTING PIT Daenerys is watching intently now. Jorah is the last man standing. He walks up to Daenerys and Hizdahr and removes his helmet. She stares at him for a moment."
4504,3,6,DAENERYS,Get him out of my sight. Her men grab Jorah.
4505,3,6,JORAH,"Khaleesi, please, I just need a moment of your time. I brought you a gift. TYRION (O.S.): It’s true. He has. Tyrion enters the pit."
4506,3,6,DAENERYS,Who are you?

4508,3,6,CERSEI,"This is horrible. Unacceptable. Are they feeding you enough at least? I brought you this. Venison. It’s quite good. I had it myself for supper only last night. We did everything we could from the moment they took your brother. Tommen even went to the sept himself to confront the high sparrow, but I fear The Faith has left reason behind."
4509,3,6,MARGAERY,I know you did this.
4510,3,6,CERSEI,We are making every effort on your behalf. I swear to you by all the seven gods.
4511,3,6,MARGAERY,"Lies come easily to you. Everyone knows that. But innocence, decency, concern? You’re not very good at those, I’m afraid. Perhaps that’s why your son was so eager to cast you aside for me."
4512,3,6,CERSEI,You’re upset. You’re not thinking clearly. I’ll visit again when you’ve had a chance to calm down.
4513,3,6,MARGAERY,I don’t want to see you again.
4514,3,6,CERSEI,"I do hope you change your mind about that. I’ve been told men often go mad in the Black Cells below the Red Keep, but I suppose your isolation will end once your trial begins."
4515,3,6,MARGAERY,Leave.
4516,3,6,CERSEI,"Yes, I’m afraid I must. My son needs me now more than ever. Margaery throws the medicine at Cersei."
4517,3,6,MARGAERY,Get out you hateful bitch!
4518,3,6,CERSEI,"Sleep well, sister. Cersei walks out smiling. She is taken to High Septon’s room by a Sparrow. INT. GREAT SEPT - CHAPEL HIGH SPARROW (to Sparrow): Thank you. (to Cersei) You saw her?"
4519,3,6,CERSEI,Yes.
4520,3,6,SPARROW,And?
4521,3,6,CERSEI,Her accommodations seem sufficient. What happens to her now?
4522,3,6,SPARROW,Well she and her brother are both being held under fair suspicion. A trial will be held for each of them to determine if they are guilty of any acts that might constitute a violation of the tenants of the faith.
4523,3,6,CERSEI,Who will stand judge?
4524,3,6,SPARROW,Seven septons. As it was in all trials before the Targaryens.
4525,3,6,CERSEI,Will you be one of them?
4526,3,6,SPARROW,I will.
4527,3,6,CERSEI,If one or both of them were to confess before the trial…
4528,3,6,SPARROW,Then they will be at The Mother’s mercy.
4529,3,6,CERSEI,What does The Mother’s mercy entail?
4530,3,6,SPARROW,"It depends on the situation. The acts themselves, the degree of contrition."
4531,3,6,CERSEI,Thank you High Septon for bringing them whatever justice they deserve in the eyes of the Seven.
4532,3,6,SPARROW,Did you know this chapel is one of the oldest structures in King’s Landing?
4533,3,6,CERSEI,I think I may have heard at one point.
4534,3,6,SPARROW,Baelor built his sept around it. But men worshipped here long before him. The High Septon gestures to a stone altar with seven-pointed stars engraved into it.
4535,3,6,SPARROW,Who carved this altar do you know?
4536,3,6,CERSEI,I’m afraid i don’t.
4537,3,6,SPARROW,"No one does. There’s no name on it. Or anywhere else in the chapel. The people who built this place didn’t inflict their vanity on the people who came after them. The way Baelor did with that great gilded monstrosity out there. Their faith was clean. Strip away the gold and the ornaments, knock down the statues and the pillars, and this is what remains. Something simple, solid, and true. The Tyrell’s finery will be stripped away. Their lives knocked down, their true hearts laid bare for all to see. And so it will be for all of us, high and low alike. What will we find when we strip away your finery? The High Septon stares intently at Cersei."
4538,3,6,SPARROW,"A young man came to us not long ago, broken in body and spirit. He had so much to strip away, so much weighing him down. But piece by piece he unburdened himself. Let go of vanity, pride, sin, now his soul is so light he will float through the Seven Heaves like a bird. Cersei gives a faint laugh."
4539,3,6,SPARROW,And he has much to say about you. Lancell enters the room and stands next to the High Septon. Cersei goes for the door and is blocked.
4540,3,6,CERSEI,Move. Let me go immediately. Cersei is grabbed and carried away from the room. CERSEI (O.S.): You will order her to let me go! I am the queen! I am the queen! Have you lost your mind? Let me go! You filthy… I am the queen! Let me go! INT. BLACK CELL Cersei is thrown into the cell. She looks up at the people who put her there.

4544,3,7,TYRION,If only I were otherwise.
4545,3,7,DAENERYS,If you are Tyrion Lannister why shouldn’t I kill you? To pay your family back for what it did to mine
4546,3,7,TYRION,You want revenge against the Lannisters? I killed my mother Joanna Lannister the day I was born. I killed my father Tywin Lannister with a bow to the heart. I am the greatest Lannister killer of our time.
4547,3,7,DAENERYS,So I should welcome you into my service because you murdered members of your own family?
4548,3,7,TYRION,Into your service? Your Grace we have only just met. It’s too soon to know if you deserve my service.
4549,3,7,DAENERYS,If you’d rather return to the fighting pits just say the word.
4550,3,7,TYRION,"When I was a young man I heard a story about a baby born during the worst storm in living memory. She had no wealth, no lands, no army, only a name and a handful of supporters, most of whom probably thought they could use that name to benefit themselves. They kept her alive, moving her from place to place, often hours ahead of the men who had been sent to kill her. She was eventually sold off to some warlord on the edge of the world and that appeared to be that. And then a few years later the most well informed person I knew told me that this girl without wealth, lands, or armies had somehow acquired all 3 in a very short span of time, along with three dragons. He thought she was our best, last chance to build a better world. I thought you were worth meeting at the very least."
4551,3,7,DAENERYS,And why are you worth meeting? Why should I spend my time listening to you?
4552,3,7,TYRION,Because you can not build a better world on your own. You have no one at your side who understands that land you want to rule. The strengths and the weaknesses of the houses that will either support or oppose you.
4553,3,7,DAENERYS,I have a very large army and very large dragons.
4554,3,7,TYRION,Killing and politics aren’t always the same thing. When I served as Hand of the King I did quite well with the latter considering the king in question preferred torturing animals to leading his people. I could do an even better job advising a ruler worth the name.
4555,3,7,DAENERYS,So you want to advise me. Very well. (looks to Jorah) What would you have me do with him? I swore I would kill him if he ever returned.
4556,3,7,TYRION,I know.
4557,3,7,DAENERYS,Why should the people trust a queen who can’t keep her promises?
4558,3,7,TYRION,"Whomever Ser Jorah was when he started informing on you, he is no longer that man. I can’t remember seeing the same man as devoted to anything as he is to serving you. He claims he would kill for you and die for you, and nothing I have witnessed gives me reason to doubt him. And yet he did betray you. Tyrion approaches Daenerys and Missandei. Her guards raise their spears to her. Daenerys waves them off."
4559,3,7,TYRION,Did he have an opportunity to confess his betrayals?
4560,3,7,DAENERYS,"Yes, many opportunities."
4561,3,7,TYRION,And did he?
4562,3,7,DAENERYS,No. Not until forced to do so.
4563,3,7,TYRION,"He worships you. He is in love with you, I think. But he did not trust you with the truth - an unpleasant truth, to be sure - but one of great significance to you. He did not trust that you would be wise enough to forgive him."
4564,3,7,DAENERYS,So I should kill him?
4565,3,7,TYRION,"A ruler who kills those that are devoted to her is not a ruler that inspires devotion. And you’re going to need to inspire devotion, and lots of it, if you’re ever going to rule across the Narrow Sea. But you cannot have him by your side when you do."
4566,3,7,DAENERYS,Remove Ser Jorah from the city. Daenerys and Jorah hold back tears. Jorah is escorted out of the Pyramid. Jorah checks his Greyscale and walks away. INT. BLACK CELLS The Septa holds water out to Cersei.
4567,3,7,SEPTA,Confess.
4568,3,7,CERSEI,My son. Let me speak to-- She slaps Cersei with a spoon.
4569,3,7,SEPTA,Confess. I meant it.
4570,3,7,CERSEI,My face will be the last thing you see before-- She slaps her with a spoon again then leaves. Cersei starts screaming. INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE
4571,3,7,ARYA,"My name is Lana. I’m an orphan. When I was 8 I begged enough money to buy my first bucket of oysters, and I sold that bucket and made enough money to buy 2 more."
4572,3,7,TO,"EXT. BRAAVOS - MARKET Arya pushes an oyster cart through a crowded market. ARYA (V.O.): Iit took a while but I finally saved enough to buy myself an oyster cart. Now every morning I make my way down to the canals. I pass the fish mongers and the bakers. I usually see Lhara, my first customer of the day on my way home. Then I turn left onto Moonsinger Lane--"
4573,3,7,TO,INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE Jaqen slaps her.
4574,3,7,ARYA,"Left onto Ragman Lane, where I do most of my trade."
4575,3,7,JAQEN,Lana is very impressive. Very industrious. She will make a fine servant for the Many Faced God.
4576,3,7,ARYA,How will she serve him?
4577,3,7,JAQEN,She will no longer turn left onto Ragman Lane. She will turn right and go to Ragman Harbor.
4578,3,7,ARYA,What will she do there?
4579,3,7,JAQEN,She will see.
4580,3,7,ARYA,See what?
4581,3,7,JAQEN,"How can a man tell a girl this. If he knew what she would see, there would be no reason to send her."
4582,3,7,ARYA,"Oysters, clams and cockles! Arya takes a right with the cart."
4583,3,7,ARYA,Oysters clams and cockles! Oysters clams and cockles!
4584,3,7,MAN,Your oysters fresh?
4585,3,7,ARYA,Best in the city.
4586,3,7,MAN,You wouldn’t lie to an old man would you? Arya cracks an oyster and hands him one he slurps it.
4587,3,7,MAN,Very nice. Give me 4. With vinegar. A man throws a bag of money and a map on the Thin Man’s table.
4588,3,7,MAN,It’s my 18th voyage. I’ve returned from all of them without a scratch on me.
4589,3,7,MAN,Can’t do it.
4590,3,7,MAN,"Please I have 3 children. Without me-- here take it you have to, I have 3 children, what will they do? Please you have to! Please! You don’t understand? He is carried away as the Thin Man slurps the oyster"
4591,3,7,TO,INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE
4592,3,7,JAQEN,The man is a gambler. He wages that his sailor's ship will make it to its destination. It is a strange wager for the captain. He only wins if he loses his life.
4593,3,7,ARYA,So why would a captain make the wager in the first place?
4594,3,7,JAQEN,A girl tells a man that she has seen.
4595,3,7,ARYA,"If the captain dies, the thin man pays his family a lot of money."
4596,3,7,JAQEN,"But perhaps the gambler loses his bet and decides that he doesn’t have to pay after all. A destitute woman and her small child, what can they do to such a man if he keeps their money for himself? To whom can they turn for recourse? Arya looks to see a man praying on the floor."
4597,3,7,ARYA,The Many Faced God. You said you didn’t know what I would see at the docks.
4598,3,7,JAQEN,A man had no idea what she would see and what she would not. A girl named Lana will return to the docks. She will watch the gambler. She will come to know as much about him as she knows about herself.
4599,3,7,ARYA,And then what?
4600,3,7,JAQEN,"A gift for the Thin Man. He holds up a clear vile. Arya takes the vile, smiling."
4601,3,7,WAIF,She is not ready.
4602,3,7,JAQEN,"Perhaps she is, perhaps she’s not."
4603,3,7,WAIF,And if she’s not?
4604,3,7,JAQEN,It is all the same to the Many Faced God. INT. BLACK CELLS Qyburn enters the cell and bows.
4605,3,7,QYBURN,The trial will take place. The High Sparrow will be presenting a substantial case against you.
4606,3,7,CERSEI,The charges?
4607,3,7,QYBURN,"Fornication, treason, incest , the murder of King Robert."
4608,3,7,CERSEI,All lies.
4609,3,7,QYBURN,"Of course, Your Grace. My concern is that The Faith does not adhere to the same standards of proof as the crown. And I hope you’ll excuse me for saying it, but belief is so often the death of reason."
4610,3,7,CERSEI,I wish you’d said it sooner. Any word from Jaime?
4611,3,7,QYBURN,"I’m afraid not. Your Grace, Grand Maester Pycelle has summoned your Uncle Kevan back from Casterly Rock to serve as Hand of the King. He now presides over the small council."
4612,3,7,CERSEI,Tell him I need to speak to him.
4613,3,7,QYBURN,I implored him to visit you but he would not.
4614,3,7,CERSEI,"What about my son, the king? If you can visit me then surely the king--"
4615,3,7,QYBURN,"Your arrest, and Queen Margaery’s arrest, the king has not taken well. He remains in his chambers, his servants often find his food in the hall. Left untouched."
4616,3,7,CERSEI,"You need to talk to him, you need to talk to my son to come and see me, come and see his mother."
4617,3,7,QYBURN,"I tried my grace, he wouldn’t see me. He wouldn’t see anyone."
4618,3,7,CERSEI,I can’t stay here.
4619,3,7,QYBURN,"There is a way, Your Grace. A way out."
4620,3,7,CERSEI,"Confess? To the High Sparrow? I won’t. I made him. I rose him up from nothing, I will not kneel before some barefooted commoner and beg his forgiveness. The septa enters the room."
4621,3,7,QYBURN,Goodbye my queen. The work continues. Qyburn leaves the cell. INT. WINTERFELL - SANSA’S CHAMBER Theon enters Sansa’s room and sets food down.
4622,3,7,SANSA,Why. Why Theon.
4623,3,7,THEON,Not Theon. There is no Theon. Reek.
4624,3,7,SANSA,"Reek. Why did you tell him, Reek?"
4625,3,7,THEON,"I was helping you. You were trying to escape, there is no escape. Not ever. Theon Greyjoy tried to escape. The master knew. He knows everything. He hunted him, he caught him, he strapped him to a cross, and cut away piece after piece until there was no Theon left."
4626,3,7,SANSA,"Good. If it weren’t for you I’d still have a family. If I could do to you what Ramsay did to you right here, right now, I would."
4627,3,7,THEON,I deserved everything. I deserve to be Reek. I did terrible things. Turned on Robb. Captured Winterfell. Killed those boys.
4628,3,7,THEON,"They weren’t “those boys”, they were Bran and Rickon. They were your brothers, you’d know them since they were born."
4629,3,7,THEON,They weren’t. They were only--
4630,3,7,SANSA,Only what?
4631,3,7,THEON,I can’t..
4632,3,7,SANSA,Tell me!
4633,3,7,THEON,"I can’t, not unless the master says..."
4634,3,7,SANSA,"Tell me, they weren’t what?!"
4635,3,7,THEON,"They weren’t... SANSA Tell me why Bran and Rickon should be dead while you still breathe the air. Tell me to my face Theon, tell me that they weren’t your brothers!"
4636,3,7,THEON,They weren’t Bran and Rickon! I couldn’t find them. It was two farm boys. I killed them and burned them so no one would know.
4637,3,7,SANSA,You didn’t…? Theon shakes his head no.
4638,3,7,SANSA,"Do you know where they went, Bran and Rickon?"
4639,3,7,THEON,I can’t talk to you anymore.
4640,3,7,SANSA,"Theon, you have to tell me, do you have any idea where Bran and Rickon--"
4641,3,7,THEON,"Not Theon, Reek! Theon runs out the door. INT. WINTERFELL - HALL"
4642,3,7,BANNERMAN,"Our scouts tells us he’s got no more than 6000 men. More than half of them are mounted, however."
4643,3,7,ROOSE,"And how high can Stannis’ horses jump? Our walls have been full repaired our walls have been reinforced. We have enough food for six months. We are more prepared for a siege than they could have ever been. All we have to do is wait for them to freeze, starve, and mutiny. Ramsay gives a disagreeing look."
4644,3,7,ROOSE,You disagree?
4645,3,7,RAMSAY,"Stannis isn’t from the North. You are, father. I think you’re missing an opportunity to show the people of the North how House Bolton treats southern invaders."
4646,3,7,ROOSE,And what do you recommend?
4647,3,7,RAMSAY,"That we not sit and wait to let Stannis to decide what type of fight this is going to be. That we hit first, and hit hard, and leave a feast for the crows ."
4648,3,7,ROOSE,A smart commander does not surrender a defensive advantage. As long as we stay behind these walls they can’t touch us. Not to mention that the snow is so deep that we couldn’t get an army through if we wanted to. RAMSAY : I don’t need an army. I need 20 good men. INT. MEEREEN
4649,3,7,DAENERYS,So have you decided yet? Whether I’m worthy of your service?
4650,3,7,TYRION,Have you decided yet whether you’re going to have me killed?
4651,3,7,DAENERYS,It’s probably my safest option.
4652,3,7,TYRION,I can see why you would think so. It’s what your father would have done.
4653,3,7,DAENERYS,And what would your father do?
4654,3,7,TYRION,My father? Who publicly sentenced me to death? I’d say his thoughts on having me killed were abundantly clear.
4655,3,7,DAENERYS,Is that why you killed him?
4656,3,7,TYRION,"Some day if you decide not to execute me, I’ll tell you all about why I killed my father. And on that day, should it ever come, we’ll need more wine than this ."
4657,3,7,DAENERYS,I know what my father was. What he did. I know the Mad King earned his name.
4658,3,7,TYRION,"So here we sit, two terrible children of two terrible fathers."
4659,3,7,DAENERYS,I’m terrible?
4660,3,7,TYRION,I’ve heard stories.
4661,3,7,DANERYS,Why did you travel to the other side of the world to meet someone terrible?
4662,3,7,TYRION,To see if you were the right kind of terrible.
4663,3,7,DAENERYS,Which kind is that?
4664,3,7,TYRION,The kind that prevents your people from being even more so.
4665,3,7,DAENERYS,I did reopen the fighting pits. Under my rule murder will once again become entertainment.
4666,3,7,TYRION,"Yes, that was wise. And you agreed to marry someone you loathed for the greater good. Very impressive. My own sister married someone she loathed as well, though not by choice and certainly not for the greater good, Gods forbid. She ended up having him killed."
4667,3,7,DAENERYS,Perhaps it won’t come to that.
4668,3,7,TYRION,It’s not impossible that Varys was right about you after all.
4669,3,7,DAENERYS,Varys? King Robert’s spy master?
4670,3,7,TYRION,Yes. He was the one who convinced me to come find you. He was my travelling companion before Ser Jorah seized that role for himself.
4671,3,7,DAENERYS,Jorah sent my secrets to Varys. For 20 years the spider oversaw the campaign to find and kill me.
4672,3,7,TYRION,He did what he had to do to survive. He did a lot of other things that he didn’t have to do. I suspect he’s the main reason you weren’t slaughtered in your crib.
4673,3,7,DAENERYS,But you trust him?
4674,3,7,TYRION,"Yes, oddly. He might be the only person in the world that I trust. Besides my brother."
4675,3,7,DAENERYS,The brother who killed my father.
4676,3,7,TYRION,That’s the one.
4677,3,7,DAENERYS,Perhaps I will have you killed after all.
4678,3,7,TYRION,"Your queenly prerogative. I had given up on life until Varys convinced me you might be worth living for. You chop off my head? Well, my final days were interesting."
4679,3,7,DAENERYS,I’m not going to kill you.
4680,3,7,TYRION,No? Banish me?
4681,3,7,DAENERYS,No.
4682,3,7,TYRION,"So if I’m not going to be murdered, and I’m not going to be banished..."
4683,3,7,DAENERYS,You’re going to advise me. (takes his wine cup) While you can still speak in complete sentences.
4684,3,7,TYRION,Advise you on what?
4685,3,7,DAENERYS,How to get what I want.
4686,3,7,TYRION,The Iron Throne. Perhaps you should try wanting something else.
4687,3,7,DAENERYS,If I want jokes I’ll get myself a proper fool.
4688,3,7,TYRION,I’m not entirely joking. There’s more to the world than Westeros after all. How many hundreds of thousands of lives have you changed for the better here? Perhaps this is where you belong. Where you can do the most good.
4689,3,7,DAENERYS,I fought so that no child born into Slaver’s Bay would ever know what it was like to be bought or sold. I will continue that fight here and beyond. But this is not my home.
4690,3,7,TYRION,"And when you get back to your home, who supports you?"
4691,3,7,DAENERYS,The common people.
4692,3,7,TYRION,"Let’s be generous and assume that’s going to happen. Here in Slaver’s Bay you had the support of the common people and only the common people. What was that like, ruling without the rich? House Targaryen is gone, not a single person who shares your blood is alive to support you. The Starks are gone as well, our two terrible fathers saw to that. The remaining Lannisters won’t back you, not ever. Stannis Baratheon won’t back you either, his entire claim to the Throne depends on the illegitimacy of yours. That leaves the Tyrells. Not impossible, but not enough."
4693,3,7,DAENERYS,"Lannister, Targaryen , Baratheon, Stark, Tyrell. They’re all just spokes on a wheel. This one's on top, then that ones on top and on and on it spins, crushing the people on the ground."
4694,3,7,TYRION,It’s a beautiful dream. Stopping the wheel. You’re not the first person to have dreamt it.
4695,3,7,DAENERYS,I’m not going to stop the wheel. I’m going to break the wheel. EXT. FIGHTING PIT Two gladiators spar. Jorah walks to the pit. The master whistles for them to stop fighting. Jorah flips him a coin.
4696,3,7,JORAH,You said whoever wins would fight at the Great Pit in front of the queen. I won.
4697,3,7,MASTER,You struck me.
4698,3,7,JORAH,I’ve been flogged if it makes you happy. I’m the best you’ve got. If I win at the Great Pit how much can you sell me for?
4699,3,7,MASTER,"You’re a free man, you could have gone anywhere, why did you come back?"
4700,3,7,JORAH,Let me fight for her and I belong to you. INT. BLACK CELLS
4701,3,7,SEPTA,Thirsty? Confess.
4702,3,7,CERSEI,"I’ll get out of here, you realize. Before long."
4703,3,7,SEPTA,Confess.
4704,3,7,CERSEI,I can make you a wealthy woman. A lady of the court.
4705,3,7,SEPTA,Confess.
4706,3,7,CERSEI,"I can make sure you die in the most hideous way imaginable, and all I do is sit here imagining ways for you to die. She dumps her water out on the floor. Cersei licks it from the floor when she leaves. INT. CASTLE BLACK - SAM’S ROOM"
4707,3,7,GILLY,Does it hurt?
4708,3,7,SAM,No.
4709,3,7,GILLY,Good.
4710,3,7,SAM,How are you?
4711,3,7,GILLY,I’m not the one who got punched and kicked in the face.
4712,3,7,SAM,You know what I mean.
4713,3,7,GILLY,I’m good.
4714,3,7,SAM,Are you scared?
4715,3,7,GILLY,A little.
4716,3,7,SAM,Me too. There is a knock on the door. Sam grabs his knife.
4717,3,7,SAM,Who’s there?
4718,3,7,OLLY,Olly. Sam puts the knife down.
4719,3,7,SAM,Come in.
4720,3,7,OLLY,I heard what happened.
4721,3,7,SAM,Not to worry. Men brawl from time to time. It’s only natural. Olly sets a tray of food on Sam’s bed.
4722,3,7,OLLY,Figured you were hungry.
4723,3,7,SAM,You’re a good lad.
4724,3,7,OLLY,Wanted to ask you something. (Olly looks at Gilly) If you’ve got the time.
4725,3,7,GILLY,I need to check on baby Sam. She exits the room.
4726,3,7,SAM,Now then. How can I help?
4727,3,7,OLLY,It’s about the Lord Commander.
4728,3,7,SAM,Yes?
4729,3,7,OLLY,He’s going up to Hardhome to save all them wildlings. Wildlings killed my mom and dad. They killed everyone in my village.
4730,3,7,SAM,We’ve been fighting them for years.
4731,3,7,OLLY,This wasn’t a fight. We were farmers and they slaughtered us. So why’s he saving them?
4732,3,7,SAM,"Wildlings are people, just like us. There are good ones and bad ones."
4733,3,7,OLLY,"The one he’s travelling with, the one with the red beard, he led the raid on my village."
4734,3,7,SAM,Olly...
4735,3,7,OLLY,How can he trust him?
4736,3,7,SAM,"I’ve seen the army of the dead. I’ve seen the white walkers, and they’re coming for us, for all the living. And when it’s time we’ll need every last man we can find."
4737,3,7,OLLY,But what if we let the wildings through the gates and they cut our throats while we sleep?
4738,3,7,SAM,"Jon’s taking a risk, but he has to. We don’t stand a chance otherwise. Sometimes a man has to make hard choices, choices that might look wrong to others but you know are right in the long run."
4739,3,7,OLLY,You believe that?
4740,3,7,SAM,With all my heart. Olly looks conflicted. He walks towards the door.
4741,3,7,SAM,Try not to worry Olly. I’ve been worrying about Jon for years. He always comes back. EXT. HARDHOME - SHORE The ships full of Crows and wildlings dock at Hardhome. Jon and Tormund get out together. The camera fixates on the swords on their hips.
4742,3,7,TORMUND,You trust me Jon Snow?
4743,3,7,JON,Does that make me a fool?
4744,3,7,TORMUND,"We are fools together now. They walk to meet the men and women of Hardhome, lead by the Lord of Bones."
4745,3,7,TORMUND,Lord of Bones. Been a long time.
4746,3,7,BONES,Last time I saw you the little crow was your prisoner. The other way around now. What happened?
4747,3,7,TORMUND,War.
4748,3,7,BONES,You call that a war? The greatest army the North has ever seen cut to pieces by a southern king.
4749,3,7,TORMUND,We should gather the elders find somewhere quiet to talk.
4750,3,7,BONES,You don’t give the orders here.
4751,3,7,TORMUND,I’m not giving an order.
4752,3,7,BONES,Why aren’t you in chains?
4753,3,7,JON,He’s not my prisoner.
4754,3,7,BONES,What is he?
4755,3,7,JON,We’re allies. The Hardhome wildlings complain loudly.
4756,3,7,BONES,You fucking traitor! You fight for the crows now.
4757,3,7,TORMUND,I don’t fight for the crows.
4758,3,7,JON,We’re not here to fight. We’re here to talk.
4759,3,7,BONES,"Is that right? You and the pretty crow do a lot of talking, Tormund. And when you’re done talking, do you get down on your knees and suck his cock-- Tormund grabs the Lord of Bones’ staff from him and beats him to death with it."
4760,3,7,TORMUND,"Gather the elders and let’s talk. INT. HARDHOME - CABIN Jon is surrounded by Karsi, a Wildling chieftess, Loboda, a Thenn, a Wildling elder, and various other Wildlings."
4761,3,7,JON,My name’s Jon Snow. I’m Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch. We’re not friends. We’ve never been friends. We won’t become friends today. This isn’t about friendship. This is about survival. This is about putting a 700 foot wall between you and what’s out there.
4762,3,7,KARSI,You built that wall to keep us out.
4763,3,7,LOBODA,Since when do the crows give 2 shits if we live?
4764,3,7,JON,In normal times we wouldn’t. But these aren’t normal times. The white walkers don’t care if a man’s Free Folk or Crow. We’re all the same to them. Meat to their army. But together we can beat them.
4765,3,7,KARSI,"Beat the white walkers? Good luck with that. Run from them, maybe. Jon holds the bag full of Dragonstone to Karsi. She looks at it hesitantly."
4766,3,7,JON,It’s not a trick. It’s a gift for those who join us. Karsi examine the glass in shock.
4767,3,7,JON,Dragonglass. A man of the Night’s Watch used one of these daggers to kill a walker.
4768,3,7,LOBODA,You saw this?
4769,3,7,JON,No. But I trust the man.
4770,3,7,KARSI,There are old stories about Dragonglass.
4771,3,7,LOBODA,There are old stories about ice spiders big as hounds.
4772,3,7,KARSI,And with the things we’ve seen you don’t believe them?
4773,3,7,JON,Come with me and I'll share these weapons.
4774,3,7,KARSI,Come with you where?
4775,3,7,JON,There are good lands south of the wall. The Night's Watch will allow you through the tunnel and allow your people to farm those lands. There is hesitation.
4776,3,7,JON,"I knew Mance Rayder. He never wanted a war with the Night’s Watch, he wanted a new life for his people. For you. We’re prepared to give you that new life."
4777,3,7,KARSI,If…?
4778,3,7,JON,If you swear you join us when the real war begins.
4779,3,7,LOBODA,Where is Mance?
4780,3,7,JON,He died.
4781,3,7,LOBODA,How? JON (after a long pause): I put an arrow through his heart. The wildlings in the cabin start to riot.
4782,3,7,LOBODA,I say we send the Lord Commander back to Castle Black with no eyes. Loboda brandishes his axe. Tormund steps forward.
4783,3,7,TORMUND,"None of you saw Mance die! I did. The Southern King who broke our army, Stannis, wanted to burn him alive to send him a message. Jon Snow defied that cunt’s orders. His arrow was mercy. What it did took courage, and that’s what we need today: the courage to make peace with men we’ve been fighting for generations."
4784,3,7,KARSI,"I lost my father, my uncle, and 2 brothers fighting the damn crows."
4785,3,7,JON,"I’m not asking you to forget your dead. I’ll never forget mine. I lost 50 brothers the night that Mance attacked the wall. But I’m asking you to think about your children now. They’ll never have children of their own if we don’t band together. The Long Night is coming and the dead come with it. No clan can stop them. The free folk can’t stop them. The Night’s Watch can’t stop them. And all the southern kings can’t stop them. Only together, all of us, and even then it might not be enough, but at least then we’ll give the fuckers a fight. There are small nods of approval throughout the room."
4786,3,7,KARSI,"You vouch for this man, Tormund?"
4787,3,7,TORMUND,"He’s prettier than both my daughters, but he knows how to fight. He’s young, but he knows how to lead. He didn’t have to come to Hardhome. He came because he needs us. And we need him."
4788,3,7,LOBODA,My ancestors would spit on me if I broke bread with a crow.
4789,3,7,KARSI,"So would mine, but fuck 'em, they’re dead. Karsi walks in front of Jon. I’ll never trust a man in black. Karsi walks over to Tormund. But I trust you, Tormund. If you say this is the way, we’re with you."
4790,3,7,TORMUND,This is the way.
4791,3,7,ELDER,I’m with Tormund. We stay here we’re dead men. At least with King Crow there’s a chance.
4792,3,7,GIANT,Tormund.
4793,3,7,LOBODA,"Keep that new life you want to give us. Keep your glass, King Crow. Soon as you get on his ships they’re gonna slit your throats and dump your bodies to the bottom of the Shivering Sea. That’s our enemy. That has always been our enemy. Wildlings start leaving the cabin and head towards the boats. KARSI (to Tormund): I fucking hate Thenns. Tormund nods. EXT. HARDHOME - SHORE Jon, Tormund, and Karsi lead the Wildlings to the boats."
4794,3,7,JON,How many are with us? 5000?
4795,3,7,TORMUND,I’m not good at counting.
4796,3,7,JON,We’re leaving too many behind.
4797,3,7,TORMUND,The free folk are stubborn. You know how long it took Mance to band them together. 20 fucking years.
4798,3,7,JON,And he knew them better than I ever will.
4799,3,7,TORMUND,They’re running out of food and there’s nothing to hunt. They’ll come around. Cut to Karsi loading two children onto a boat.
4800,3,7,KARSI,"Johnna is gonna look after you. She’s in charge, you listen to her."
4801,3,7,DAUGHTER,I wanna go with you.
4802,3,7,KARSI,"I need to get the old folks on the boats. I’m right behind you, I promise. (she kisses them on the forehead) Go on. INT. HARDHOME - CABIN The Giant picks up a piece of Dragonglass and strokes it intently. Edd begins picking up the pieces of glass and looks at the giant with his piece of glass. Wun Wun turns to Edd and stares at him annoyed."
4803,3,7,WUN,Lokh kif rukh? Edd leaves. Dogs are barking outside. EXT. HARDHOME - SHORE Jon loads girls onto a boat then turns to hear the dogs barking. The wind starts whipping from a neighboring cliff and the dogs start whimpering. Every wildling and Crow slowly turns to the source of the noise. EXT. HARDHOME - GATE
4804,3,7,LOBODA,Shut the gate. Men hurry towards the gate to board it up. More howling from the distance. The Wildlings on the other side of the gate begin charging the gate.
4805,3,7,LOBODA,Shut the gate!! Men rush to put a board in place to hold the gate shut.
4806,3,7,SHOUTING,"Wait! Open the gate! Let us in! Help us! Please open it! Loboda walks to the gate with his axe and peers through a small hole in the wall. There is a faint scream in the distance, then a wight charges at the hole in the wall."
4807,3,7,LOBODA,Ready your arrows! The wights claw at the gate. Arrows are nocked and fired. A wight sticks his hand through the gate and Loboda chops it off. EXT. HARDHOME - SHORE There is a mad rush towards the boats with many people jumping in the water to catch one.
4808,3,7,JON,"Get in line! Get in line! EXT. HARDHOME - GATE A wight tries to climb the gate. INT. HARDHOME - CABIN Wights crawl to the top of the cabin and jumps through the hole in the roof. The men prepare their weapons and the giant growls. EXT. HARDHOME - GATE One wight tries to climb under the gate. A barrage of arrows flies at the wights trying to get through the wall. Most of them land. The wight crawls even further under the gate. The wights start making holes in the gate. A sword sticks through the gate coming close to Loboda on the gate. Loboda dodges the sword, looks down to see the wight crawling under the gate, and stomps its head in. EXT. HARDHOME - SHORE The people continue to rush onto the boats with Jon, Tormund, and Karsi leading them."
4809,3,7,JON,Hold the line! Hold the line!
4810,3,7,BROTHER,Lord Commander!
4811,3,7,JON,Get them to the ship and come back for me!
4812,3,7,BROTHER,But you’ll never make it--
4813,3,7,JON,Now! Karsi approaches Jon.
4814,3,7,JON,You should be on one of those boats.
4815,3,7,KARSI,So should you ! My little girl has gone on. They're gonna let them pass the wall even if you’re not there ?
4816,3,7,JON,You have my word. I’ve given orders.
4817,3,7,KARSI,Don’t think you’re gonna be there to enforce those orders ! Karsi heads back to helping people onto the boats.
4818,3,7,TORMUND,"If they get through, everyone dies !"
4819,3,7,JON,"Night’s Watch with me! Move! Move! Move! Jon, Tormund, Karsi, and the Night’s Watch brothers charge from the shore to the gate. EXT. HARDHOME - SHORE The wights have knocked a hole into the gate big enough to crawl out of. One breaks through, tears someone apart, and then is taken down. A group of wights storm through the same hole. Cut to an overhead that shows just how many wights are behind the gate. Jon arrives at the gate. He pins a wight to the gate with Longclaw as Tormund and Karsi kill the wights that have already gotten through. The archers take out the wight Jon pinned to the gate, and then the men cover the hole the wights had been escaping from with a sled. Fighting continues. A group of wights tear into a Crow. Loboda and Karsi continue to kill the wights. Jon looks up through the mist and sees 4 White Walkers on horseback on the top of the cliff."
4820,3,7,JON,The Dragonglass!
4821,3,7,LOBODA,"You’re with me, lad! Now! Jon and Loboda charge towards the cabin. Jon cuts a wight in half then kills another. The giant breaks through a wall in the cabin as the cabin starts to go down in flames. He shakes the wights off of his back, snapping some in half and stomping others into pieces. Jon and Loboda storm the cabin. INT. HARDHOME - CABIN The entire cabin is on fire. A White Walker wielding a staff walks towards them through the fire."
4822,3,7,LOBODA,"Get the glass. Loboda walks towards the White Walker as Jon scrambles towards the Dragonglass. Loboda misses with his axe twice, getting it caught in the wall. He pulls it out to parry in time, but the Walker’s spear shatters his axe. The Walker plunges his spear through Loboda's stomach. Jon reaches the glass but is thrown across the room by the Walker before he can pick it up, causing Longclaw to fly out of the cabin. Jon ducks from the Walker’s swings with his spear, and runs out to grab another sword. The Walker swings and shatters the sword. He knocks Jon down again. Jon struggles, then gets up again, running to pick up Longclaw. He stumbles and drops the sword. The White Walker staggers towards him. Jon picks up Longclaw just in time to match the White Walker, and to both of their surprises, Longclaw stops the Walker’s spear. The Walker deflects one blow from Jon, but then he swings and shatters the Walker into pieces. Jon falls to the ground after the struggle. The Night’s King watches him alone from the top of the cliff. EXT. HARDHOME - GATE Tormund and Karsi continue to tear through wights. Karsi looks up, and sees a group of blue-eyed wight children staring at her. They do nothing for a moment, then charge at her, chewing and clawing her to death. Cut to Jon crawling across the snow, coughing up blood. A man grabs him and Jon puts Longclaw to his neck. The man turns out to be Edd and they lower their weapons."
4823,3,7,JON,The Dragonglass!
4824,3,7,EDD,"Fuck the glass! We’re gonna die here. A screech comes from the top of the cliff. Hundreds of wights dive from the top of the cliff. They appear to have died for a brief moment after landing, but then wake up and charge at Jon and Edd. Cut to Tormund continuing to hold the gate. The gate starts creaking then comes down. Tormund runs to the boat. The giant starts roaring as the other gate comes down, swinging a fiery log. Jon, Tormund, and Edd sprint towards the boat with the giant clearing a path for them with the log. The Night’s King continues to watch them from the top of the cliff. EXT. HARDHOME - SHORE Jon, Tormund, and the Crow jump off the dock onto the boat."
4825,3,7,JON,Go! Go! Go!
4826,3,7,TORMUND,"Wun Wun, to the sea. The giant stays back, continuing to take out loads of wights by swinging his flaming log. He begins to walk towards the boat, ripping the wights hanging onto him off of his back and throwing them into the water to die."
4827,3,8,DEFAULT,"The Dance of Dragons (Script) Lyrics EXT. STANNIS’ CAMP - NIGHT A man walks by each of the tents. INT. MELISANDRE’S TENT Melisandre stares into the fire. She exits the tent. EXT. STANNIS’ CAMP - NIGHT Melisandre surveys the camp. In the distance, a tent catches on fire. Men start screaming and rushing out of their tents. A burning horse runs by Melisandre. EXT. STANNIS’ CAMP - MORNING"
4828,3,8,DAVOS,"A band of 20 men, maybe less. They were in and out before anyone spotted them, burnt our food stores to the ground, all our siege weapons were destroyed, dozens of tents were--"
4829,3,8,STANNIS,Horses?
4830,3,8,DAVOS,"We’re still getting a count, but hundreds are dead."
4831,3,8,STANNIS,20 men rode into our camp without a single guard sounding the alarm?
4832,3,8,DAVOS,The northerners know more about their land than we ever will.
4833,3,8,STANNIS,"Put last night’s guards in chains, either they fell asleep or they were conspiring with the enemy. Find out the truth and then hang them."
4834,3,8,DAVOS,"Unless there’s a thaw, we can’t press forward to Winterfell, and we don’t have enough food to get us back to Castle Black."
4835,3,8,STANNIS,We’re not returning to Castle Black.
4836,3,8,DAVOS,"Forgive me, Your Grace, I never claimed to be an expert in military matters. But if we can’t march forward, and we won’t march back… Stannis looks to Melisandre and Selyse. Davos follows his gaze then looks back."
4837,3,8,STANNIS,"Have the dead horses butchered for meat. Stannis walks over to Melisandre. EXT. THE WALL The Hardhome survivors, led by Jon, Tormund, Tollett, and Wun-Wun, approach the wall. Alliser looks down at the group. Jon steps forward, Alliser stares for a moment, then--"
4838,3,8,ALLISER,Open the gates. The lower gate is lifted. EXT. CASTLE BLACK The Hardhome Wildlings are being escorted through Castle Black.
4839,3,8,JON,It was a failure.
4840,3,8,SAM,It wasn’t.
4841,3,8,JON,"I went to save them, I failed."
4842,3,8,SAM,"You didn’t fail him, or him, or her. Every one of them is alive because of you, and no one else."
4843,3,8,JON,"I don’t think that fact’s lost on them. Cut to many men of the Night’s Watch glaring at Jon, then Olly who exchanges a long look with Jon from the top of the stairs. Alliser walks down the steps to Jon."
4844,3,8,ALLISER,"You have a good heart, Jon Snow. It will get us all killed. INT. STANNIS’ TENT Stannis is studying his chessboard. There are 2 Baratheon pieces next to a sword and opposed to 2 Bolton pieces. Davos enters the tent."
4845,3,8,DAVOS,"You sent for me, Your Grace."
4846,3,8,STANNIS,"Find you some healthy horses and a few good men to guard you, I’m sending you back to Castle Black. Tell the Lord Commander to send food, supplies, fresh horses, in return when I take the throne I’ll make sure the Night’s Watch has all the men it requires. He can guard all 19 castles if he so wishes."
4847,3,8,DAVOS,"Your Grace, you’ve named me your Hand."
4848,3,8,STANNIS,Yes.
4849,3,8,DAVOS,"The King’s Hand should never abandon the King, especially in a time of war."
4850,3,8,STANNIS,"You’re not abandoning me, you’re obeying a command."
4851,3,8,DAVOS,A boy with a scroll could deliver this message.
4852,3,8,STANNIS,"And if Jon Snow refuses a boy with a scroll, what does the boy say? I didn’t name you hand for your expertise in military matters, ride for Castle Black, don’t come back empty handed."
4853,3,8,DAVOS,"Your Grace, perhaps Queen and Princess Shireen could accompany me."
4854,3,8,STANNIS,My family stays with me.
4855,3,8,DAVOS,At least let me take Shireen. A siege is no place for a little girl.
4856,3,8,STANNIS,"My family stays with me. EXT. STANNIS’ CAMP The men are shivering, waiting in line for food. Davos walks by. INT. SHIREEN’S TENT Shireen is reading one of her books. Davos enters."
4857,3,8,DAVOS,What’s this one now?
4858,3,8,SHIREEN,"""The Dance of Dragons: A True Telling"" by Grand Maester Munkun."
4859,3,8,DAVOS,Well that sounds like a proper story.
4860,3,8,SHIREEN,"Ser Byron Swann wanted to kill the dragon Vhagar. He polished his shield for a week, til the steel was like a mirror. Then he crouched behind it, and crept forward, hoping the dragon would only see his own reflection."
4861,3,8,DAVOS,"But the dragon only saw a dumb man, holding a mirrored shield."
4862,3,8,SHIREEN,And burnt him to a crisp. Davos and Shireen share a laugh.
4863,3,8,DAVOS,"Thus ending the dragonslaying career of Ser Byron Swann. I made you something, Princess. Davos hands her a stag carved out of wood."
4864,3,8,DAVOS,Do you like it?
4865,3,8,SHIREEN,He’s beautiful. Shireen kisses him on the cheek.
4866,3,8,SHIREEN,Thank you.
4867,3,8,DAVOS,You’re very welcome.
4868,3,8,SHIREEN,"Will you make me a doe, too, so that he can have company?"
4869,3,8,DAVOS,Of course I will.
4870,3,8,SHIREEN,But why am I getting a present?
4871,3,8,DAVOS,"Because you deserve it. My son was always on me trying to teach me to read. Gods, I was stubborn about it. Made it this far without reading, seemed to me I could make it to the grave. I wish I had listened to them. This is my own poor way of saying thank you for teaching me to be a grown up. (beat) I’ll be gone for a few days, Princess. I’ll want to hear all about the dance of dragons when I’m back."
4872,3,8,SHIREEN,You’ll just have to read it yourself. Davos kisses Shireen on her forehead then leaves. Shireen looks over the stag. INT. DORNE - PALACE Jaime is escorted by Areo to Doran’s room.
4873,3,8,JAIME,Prince Doran. (bows)
4874,3,8,DORAN,"Forgive us, we started without you. Please, sit."
4875,3,8,JAIME,Princess Myrcella.
4876,3,8,MYRCELLA,Uncle.
4877,3,8,JAIME,What a lovely dress.
4878,3,8,MYRCELLA,You don’t like it?
4879,3,8,JAIME,You must be cold.
4880,3,8,MYRCELLA,Not at all. The Dornish climate agrees with me.
4881,3,8,JAIME,Prince Trystane. How’s your jaw?
4882,3,8,TRYSTANE,A fleabite.
4883,3,8,ELLARIA,What are you doing in Dorne?
4884,3,8,JAIME,"Looking out for the safety of my niece, the princess Myrcella."
4885,3,8,DORAN,And rather than send a raven or speak to me directly you decided to enter my country in secret and abduct our guest by force.
4886,3,8,JAIME,We received a threatening message. The princess’s necklace in the jaws of a viper. Jaime looks at Ellaria. MYRCELLA (surprised): That necklace was stolen from my room. Doran looks at Ellaria. A servant sets down food and drink before Jaime.
4887,3,8,JAIME,Ah. Excellent. The last meal before the beheading.
4888,3,8,DORAN,We can’t behead you. Many in Dorne want war. But I’ve seen war. I’ve seen the bodies piled on the battlefields. I’ve seen the orphans starving in the cities. I don’t want to lead my people into that hell.
4889,3,8,ELLARIA,"No, you want to break bread with the Lannisters."
4890,3,8,DORAN,"And that is precisely what we are doing. (raises glass) Let us drink to Tommen, the first of his name, the King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms. Everyone drinks. Ellaria dumps her cup out on the floor and looks at Doran."
4891,3,8,DORAN,King Tommen insists on his sister’s return to the capital?
4892,3,8,JAIME,I’m afraid he does.
4893,3,8,DORAN,"I cannot disobey my King’s command. (Ellaria glares at Doran) She will return with you to King’s Landing. And my son, Prince Trystane, will accompany you both. If the alliance between Dorne and the Iron Throne is to continue, their engagement must stand."
4894,3,8,JAIME,I accept.
4895,3,8,DORAN,"One more thing. My brother was named to the small council before his death. Your father understood the importance of keeping Dorne in the loop. With Oberyn gone, Trystane will take his place on the small council."
4896,3,8,JAIME,You have my word.
4897,3,8,ELLARIA,The word of a Kingslayer. Ellaria gets up and walks to Doran.
4898,3,8,ELLARIA,No wonder you can’t stand. You have no spine. Ellaria tries to leave the room. Doran grabs her wrist.
4899,3,8,DORAN,"You are mother to four of my nieces, girls I love very much. For their sake, I hope you live a long life. Talk to me that way again and you won’t. Doran lets go. Ellaria leaves the room."
4900,3,8,JAIME,May I inquire into the fate of my man?
4901,3,8,DORAN,"Tell me, Ser Jaime, in King’s Landing, how do they punish a commoner who strikes a prince?"
4902,3,8,JAIME,He said it was just a fleabite. The fault is mine. Bronn is merely a soldier following my orders. If anyone should be punished it’s me.
4903,3,8,DORAN,Prince Trystane must learn judgement if he’s to rule one day. I’ll let him decide. Jaime looks to Trystane. Trystane considers.
4904,3,8,TRYSTANE,I have learned the value of mercy from my father. I will set your man free.
4905,3,8,JAIME,You’re a good man.
4906,3,8,TRYSTANE,On one condition. INT. DORNE - CELL Bronn is laying on the ground in his cell. Tyene and Nymeria are playing a game where one tries to slap the other’s hand before they pull their hands away. Nymeria slaps Tyene.
4907,3,8,NYMERIA,"Why do we play? I’m better than you, I’ll always be better than you. Have I ever missed once? I don’t think, I can’t recall. You must love humiliation or pain. Which do you love most? Humiliation or-- (slaps) -- pain? That one hurt didn’t it? You going to cry? Give up, little sister."
4908,3,8,TYENE,You’re going to miss.
4909,3,8,NYMERIA,I never miss.
4910,3,8,TYENE,You will. You’re thinking too much. Now you’re nervous. “What if she’s right?” Nymeria slaps at Tyene and Tyene gets out of the way in time.
4911,3,8,NYMERIA,Luck.
4912,3,8,TYENE,Now it’s my turn.
4913,3,8,NYMERIA,You’re too slow. You’ve always been too slow. Nymeria sticks her hands out and blows a kiss to Tyene. Tyene slaps her across the face then blows one back. They get in fighting stances as the guards arrive. They take Bronn out of his cell.
4914,3,8,BRONN,Am I going to be happy at the end of this walk?
4915,3,8,AREO,You’ll find out very soon. Bronn starts leaving the prison.
4916,3,8,TYENE,"Say it one more time, handsome. Who am I?"
4917,3,8,BRONN,The most beautiful woman in the world.
4918,3,8,TYENE,And that’s the truth!
4919,3,8,NYMERIA,Slut. Tyene laughs. INT. DORNE - PALACE Areo escorts Bronn into Doran’s room.
4920,3,8,JAIME,"Prince Doran, Ser Bronn of the Blackwater."
4921,3,8,DORAN,: I didn’t realize there were knights of the Blackwater.
4922,3,8,BRONN,Only the one.
4923,3,8,JAIME,I believe you’ve already met Prince Trystane.
4924,3,8,BRONN,Prince. Sorry about the other day.
4925,3,8,JAIME,Prince Trystane here is a man of mercy. He’s agreed to grant you your freedom.
4926,3,8,BRONN,I’m glad to hear it. The pie looks good.
4927,3,8,JAIME,"There was one condition. Jaime nods to Areo. Areo elbows Bronn in the jaw, knocking him to the ground."
4928,3,8,DORAN,Perhaps some soup instead? EXT. BRAAVOS - RAGMAN HARBOR Arya pushes her oyster cart through the street.
4929,3,8,ARYA,"Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cock-- Two shady looking men approach her."
4930,3,8,MAN,"How much for your little clam? They laugh and walk away. Arya looks down the street and sees the Thin Man, looking over another sailor’s application."
4931,3,8,ARYA,"Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cockels! Arya stops her cart, inspects the vile Jaqen gave to her, and tucks it back in her pouch. She starts pushing the cart again and makes eye contact with the Thin Man. THIN MAN (waving): Come on. Arya stares off into the distance."
4932,3,8,MAN,"Some oysters, girl! I’m talking to you! Girl?! Are you deaf? Girl?! Arya looks to the dock, and sees Meryn Trant and Mace Tyrell being helped off the boat. A Iron Banker approaches him and Arya starts walking away from the Thin Man and towards them."
4933,3,8,BANKER,"Lord Tyrell! On behalf of the Iron Bank, may I be the first to welcome you to the free city of Braavos. I hope your journey was trouble free."
4934,3,8,MACE,Bit of chop the last few days but nothing too awful. Good to see the old chap is still guarding the Harbor.
4935,3,8,BANKER,And how goes the harvest in the Reach?
4936,3,8,MACE,"Vintnors say this might be the best year for red grapes in half a century. If we come to a satisfactory arrangement, I’ll be sure to send the Arbor’s finest your way."
4937,3,8,BANKER,"I’m afraid I don’t partake. Arya studies the group, focuses in on Meryn, and begins following them with her cart. EXT. BRAAVOS - IRON BANK"
4938,3,8,MACE,"Some consider usury distasteful, dishonorable. Pure nonsense, of course."
4939,3,8,BANKER,I'm glad we see eye-to-eye on this matter.
4940,3,8,MACE,Did you know that at one point Maegor the third tried to outlaw it in the Seven Kingdoms? Wanted to arrest anyone caught charging interest and cut off both their hands. Meryn and Arya exchange quick looks at each other.
4941,3,8,BANKER,Most unfortunate for the glovers.
4942,3,8,MACE,"If a man charges low interest on a loan then he has nothing to gain and everything to lose, so why charge him? Whereas a reward makes a man willing to gamble."
4943,3,8,BANKER,"We are not gamblers here at the Iron Bank, Lord Tyrell."
4944,3,8,MACE,"You are the world's best gamblers. And all those bets you won built this. Mace gestures to the Iron Bank and the camera cuts to it. EXT. IRON BANK - LATER Arya is waiting on the steps of the building opposite the bank, eating her oysters. The men start walking out of the Bank."
4945,3,8,BANKER,I’m afraid I still have a good deal of work to do.
4946,3,8,MACE,"Oh, nonsense. Work's over. Do you sing?"
4947,3,8,BANKER,I don't have that gift.
4948,3,8,MACE,"It's not a gift, it’s a skill, anyone can learn it. “So give me a kiss by the Long Canall and give me two kisses in Salty Town, for we are going to die, tomorrow. The bareheaded beggar, the king with his crown…” INT. BRAAVOS - BROTHEL - DOORWAY Meryn Trant and his men walk through the doorway."
4949,3,8,MERYN,I thought that old shit would never stop singing.
4950,3,8,MAN,"It wasn’t bad, though."
4951,3,8,MERYN,"The Tyrells can all rot in hell, treasonous cunts. They were going to make that boy-fucker Renly king. They arrive at a door."
4952,3,8,MERYN,"This is the place, lads. The sleekest little minks in Braavos."
4953,3,8,MAN,You’re buying?
4954,3,8,MERYN,"Oh, I’m buying. But I never was good at sharing. They enter the brothel. Arya pulls up to the doorway with her cart and sees the men entering. INT. BROTHEL Arya walks through the door with a tray of oysters. The brothel keeper stops her."
4955,3,8,KEEPER,Sell your fish somewhere else.
4956,3,8,PROSTITUTE,"Oh let her in, Brusco , I’m hungry. Come here, sweetness. The brothel keeper gestures nods for Arya to go on. She walks to the prostitute and the man she’s with."
4957,3,8,PROSTITUTE,They say oyster’s get the juices flowing. We’ll take half a dozen.
4958,3,8,ARYA,Three coppers . Arya begins cutting an oyster open.
4959,3,8,JOHN,Here’s a silver because the lady likes you. The man places a silver on her tray in exchange for the oysters. Arya turns and sees Trant’s men being taken to a back room. INT. BROTHEL - BACK ROOM Arya enters the room and peers through a divider to see a prostitute posing for Meryn.
4960,3,8,MERYN,Too old.
4961,3,8,PROSTITUTE,Brea. Brea poses for Meryn.
4962,3,8,MERYN,Too old.
4963,3,8,HEAD,"I have just the one. Anara our most expensive girl, but well worth it, I assure you. A younger, 20-something prostitute poses for Meryn."
4964,3,8,MERYN,Too old. The people in the room share uneasy glances as they realize what he’s asking for.
4965,3,8,MERYN,Do you have what I want or not?
4966,3,8,HEAD,Of course. Of course. One of Trant’s men crosses to the other side of the divider and confronts Arya.
4967,3,8,MAN,"Fresh? Come on, the lads are hungry. The man drags her into the room."
4968,3,8,MAN,Nothing better for you cock stand than fresh oysters. MAN 2: I’ll have one. Meryn stares at Arya.
4969,3,8,HEAD,Who let this girl in? Shoo shoo! The head prostitute brings in a child.
4970,3,8,MERYN,Good. The head prostitute hands Meryn an hourglass. He hands it back.
4971,3,8,MERYN,I’ll tell you when we’re done. He leads the girl towards a bedroom.
4972,3,8,MERYN,You’ll have a fresh one for me tomorrow.
4973,3,8,HEAD,Of course. The head prostitute realizes Arya is still standing there.
4974,3,8,HEAD,"I’ll have you whipped, girl! Go on! Arya leaves the room, but takes one last glance at where Meryn is taking the girl. INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE Jaqen kneels next to a man at the fountain of the center of the room and offers him a drink from the fountain."
4975,3,8,MAN,Valaar morghulis. The man takes a drink. Arya approaches Jaqen.
4976,3,8,JAQEN,And?
4977,3,8,ARYA,The Thin Man wasn’t hungry today.
4978,3,8,JAQEN,"Perhaps that’s why the man is thin. The man drops to the ground, creating a thud off-screen."
4979,3,8,ARYA,Tomorrow.
4980,3,8,JAQEN,Tomorrow.
4981,3,8,JAQEN,A girl has work to do. Arya walks towards the man who is now collapsed on the ground. INT. DORNE - PALACE Doran is addressing Ellaria with Areo standing guard next to the three Sand Snakes.
4982,3,8,DORAN,"Your rebellion is over. You can swear your allegiance to me now, or you can die. She kneels and kisses his ring, crying. Nymeria and Obara look disgusted, Tyene’s face reveals less."
4983,3,8,DORAN,I believe in second chances. I don’t believe in third chances. INT. DORNE - JAIME’S ROOM Jaime is writing a letter in his former cell that is now unlocked. Ellaria enters.
4984,3,8,ELLARIA,You write like a 7 year old.
4985,3,8,JAIME,Your maester kindly agreed to copy it over for me.
4986,3,8,ELLARIA,He didn’t try to make you pay?
4987,3,8,ELLARIA,Then maybe he’s changed. The Queen will be thrilled to know you’ll be bringing her daughter home
4988,3,8,JAIME,She will.
4989,3,8,ELLARIA,"You love her very much, don’t you?"
4990,3,8,JAIME,"Of course, she’s my niece."
4991,3,8,ELLARIA,I wasn’t talking about her. Jaime looks up from his writing at Ellaria.
4992,3,8,ELLARIA,"You think I disapprove. Why? Because people disapprove of that sort of thing where you are from? They disapproved of Oberyn and me where you are from. Here, no one blinked an eye. 100 years ago, no one would have blinked an eye at you if you had been named Targaryen.  It’s always changing, who we’re supposed to love and who we’re not.The only thing that stays the same is that we want who we want. Ellaria pauses, taking a walks around the room."
4993,3,8,ELLARIA,I know your daughter had no part in the terrible thing that happened to the man I loved. Perhaps even you were innocent of that. Ellaria exits the room. INT. SHIREEN’S TENT Shireen plays with her stag figurine next to a fire and on top of her book. Stannis enters the tent.
4994,3,8,SHIREEN,Father. Aren’t you cold?
4995,3,8,STANNIS,No. What are you reading?
4996,3,8,SHIREEN,The Dance of Dragons.
4997,3,8,STANNIS,What’s it about?
4998,3,8,SHIREEN,"It’s the story of the fight between Rhaenyra Targaryen and her half-brother Aegon for control of the Seven Kingdoms. Both of them thought they belonged on the Iron Throne. When people started for declaring for one of them or the other, their fight divided the kingdom in two. Brothers fought brothers. Dragons fought dragons. By the time it was over, thousands were dead. And it was a disaster for the Targaryens as well. They never truly recovered."
4999,3,8,STANNIS,“The dance of dragons”? Why is that a dance?
5000,3,8,SHIREEN,That’s just what they call it.
5001,3,8,STANNIS,Doesn’t make much sense.
5002,3,8,SHIREEN,I think it’s poetic.
5003,3,8,STANNIS,"If you had to choose between Rhaenyra and Aegon, who would you have chosen?"
5004,3,8,SHIREEN,I wouldn’t have chosen either. It’s all the choosing sides that made things so horrible.
5005,3,8,STANNIS,"Sometimes a person has to choose. Sometimes the world forces his hand. If a man knows what he is and remains true to himself, the choice is not choice at all. He must fulfill his destiny and become who he is meant to be. However much he may hate it."
5006,3,8,SHIREEN,"It’s alright, father."
5007,3,8,STANNIS,You don’t even know what I’m talking about.
5008,3,8,SHIREEN,It doesn’t matter. I want to help you. Is there any way I can help?
5009,3,8,STANNIS,Yes there is.
5010,3,8,SHIREEN,"Good, I want to. I’m the Princess Shireen of House Baratheon and I’m your daughter. They hug."
5011,3,8,STANNIS,"Forgive me. EXT. STANNIS’ CAMP Shireen is flanked by guards as she walks towards a pyre, clutching the stag Davos gave her. When she arrives at the pyre Melisandre steps to the front."
5012,3,8,SHIREEN,Where’s my father? I want to see my father.
5013,3,8,MELISANDRE,"It will all be over soon, Princess. The men drag her to the pyre and tie her up."
5014,3,8,SHIREEN,"Where’s my father? No you can’t do this, father where are you?! Stannis watches on from the crowd."
5015,3,8,SHIREEN,"Let me see my father! Where are you, please?!"
5016,3,8,SELYSE,It’s what the Lord wants. It’s a good thing. A great thing.
5017,3,8,MELISANDRE,"The year is now, my Lord. For you we offer up this girl, that you may cleanse her with your fire and that its light may lead our way."
5018,3,8,SELYSE,"If we don’t act then we’ll all starve here all of us, but if we make this sacrifice…"
5019,3,8,MELISANDRE,"Accept this token of our faith, my lord and lead us from the darkness. Lord of Light show us the way!"
5020,3,8,SHIREEN,"Mother, please mother! Mother, please mother!"
5021,3,8,SELYSE,I can’t.
5022,3,8,STANNIS,There’s no other way. She has King’s blood.
5023,3,8,MELISANDRE,"Lord of Light protect us, for the night is dark and full of terrors!"
5024,3,8,SHIREEN,"Mother, don’t do this please! Please help! Don’t do this! Please, father! Mother, help! Melisandre lights the pyre. Selyse runs towards the pyre and is stopped by Stannis’ men. Shireen burns as Melisandre, Selyse, and Stannis look on, Melisandre pleased, Selyse horrified, and Stannis conflicted."
5025,3,8,SELYSE,"No... EXT. MEEREEN - FIGHTING PIT Daenerys sits next to Missandei at the top of the pit, with an open seat between her and Tyrion at the end, and Daario standing behind them. Hizdahr takes the open seat."
5026,3,8,DAENERYS,Where have you been?
5027,3,8,HIZDAHR,"Just making sure everything’s in order. Camera pans through the fighting pit to reveal it is covered with House Targaryen sigils. An announcer steps to the middle of the pit and waves his arm to silence the crowd. ANNOUNCER (Valyrian): Free citizens of Meereen! By the blessings of the Graces and her majesty the Queen, welcome to the Great Games! The Announcer raises his hands and the crowd begins to roar. Cut to Daenerys’ box - she and Missandei look disgusted, Daario looks impressed. Two gladiators enter the pit."
5028,3,8,ANNOUNCER,"My queen, our first contest. Who will triumph: the strong or the quick?"
5029,3,8,QUICK,"I fight and die for your glory, oh glorious queen."
5030,3,8,STRONG,"I fight and die for your glory, oh glorious queen. They stand waiting in front of her. The crowd is silent."
5031,3,8,HIZDAHR,"They’re waiting for you. Clap your hands. Daenerys looks down at the two men. After a moment, and with a look of disgust on her face, she claps her hands. The crowd roars and they start fighting. After some parries, the Quick man slices at the Strong man’s neck."
5032,3,8,DAARIO,"That one, the smaller man, no question, that’s where you should put your money."
5033,3,8,TYRION,The smaller man it is.
5034,3,8,DAENERYS,I’m not putting my money anywhere.
5035,3,8,HIZDAHR,Kings and queens never bet on the games. Perhaps you should go find someone who does.
5036,3,8,DAARIO,People used to bet against me when I fought in the pits. (looks at Hizdahr) He would have bet against me. Common novice mistake.
5037,3,8,HIZDAHR,"I have spent much of my life in Meereen, and in my experience, larger men do triumph over smaller man, far more often than not."
5038,3,8,DAENERYS,"Has your experience ever involved any actual fighting? You, yourself, have you ever tried to kill a man that was trying to kill you? Hizdahr is silent."
5039,3,8,DAARIO,"Whenever I got into the pit against a beast like that one, the crowd saw me, all skin and bone back then, then they saw a pile of angry muscles ready to murder me. They couldn’t get their money out fast enough. But the pile of angry muscles never had any muscles here (he puts a dagger to his neck) or here (he puts the dagger to Hizdahr’s neck). And the big men were always too slow to stop my dagger from going where their muscles weren’t. Yes, whenever I saw a beast like that one, standing across from me making his beast faces, I knew I could rest easy. The Strong man decapitates the Quick man with one quick stroke. Hizdahr smiles and Daario looks turns away angrily. Tyrion says nothing."
5040,3,8,HIZDAHR,You don’t approve?
5041,3,8,TYRION,There’s always been more than enough death in the world for my taste. I can do without it in my leisure time.
5042,3,8,HIZDAHR,"Fair enough, yet -- it’s an unpleasant question -- but what great thing has ever been accomplished without killing or cruelty?"
5043,3,8,TYRION,It’s easy to confuse what is with what ought to be. Especially when what is has worked in your favor.
5044,3,8,HIZDAHR,"I’m not talking about myself. I’m talking about the necessary conditions of greatness. Cut to pit workers carrying the decapitated head out of the pit, leaving a trail of blood behind."
5045,3,8,DAENERYS,That is greatness?
5046,3,8,HIZDAHR,That is a vital part of the great city of Meereen. Which has existed long before you arrived and will remain standing long after we have returned to the dirt.
5047,3,8,TYRION,My father would have liked you.
5048,3,8,ANNOUNCER,We ask again: who will triumph?
5049,3,8,DAENERYS,One day your great city will return to the dirt as well.
5050,3,8,HIZDAHR,At your command?
5051,3,8,DAENERYS,If need be.
5052,3,8,ANNOUNCER,A Meereenese champion? The crowd applauds.
5053,3,8,HIZDAHR,How many people will die to make this happen?
5054,3,8,DAENERYS,If it comes to that they would have died for a good reason. HIZDAHR (looks at pit): Those men think they’re dying for a good reason.
5055,3,8,DAENERYS,Someone else’s reason.
5056,3,8,HIZDAHR,"So your reasons are true, and theirs are false. They don’t know their own minds, but you do."
5057,3,8,TYRION,"Well said, you’re an eloquent man. Doesn’t mean you’re wrong. In my experience, eloquent men are right every bit as often as imbeciles."
5058,3,8,ANNOUNCER,"...or a Westerosi Knight?! Crowd jeers. JORAH (O.S.): I fight and die for your glory, oh glorious Queen. Daenerys stares at Jorah. They both hold back emotion."
5059,3,8,HIZDAHR,Your Grace--
5060,3,8,DAARIO,"Shut your mouth. Daenerys claps. Jorah nods. They begin fighting, with Daenerys’ eyes following Jorah. He takes a blow to the mouth, is knocked down and starts bleeding. He gets up, has his sword knocked away, and pulls out a dagger. He wrestles with the man trying to choke him, throws him off, then stabs him in the chest. He pulls the dagger out, looking at Daenerys, throws it away, and picks up his longsword. Jorah squares off against a flashy fighter that just brutally stabbed another fighter through the back. He slices Jorah in the cheek. The other two fighters square off, with a heavily armored fighter wielding a spear killing his opponent. The crowd cheers. Jorah’s opponent slices Jorah’s arm then knocks him over, knocking his sword out of his hand. He holds his blade to Jorah’s throat. Both he and Jorah look to Daenerys."
5061,3,8,TYRION,You can end this.
5062,3,8,HIZDAHR,She cannot.
5063,3,8,TYRION,"You can! The fighter holds his blade to Jorah’s throat. He is about to make a move when the other fighter comes over and stabs Jorah’s opponent in the back, killing him. Jorah gets up and faces the final opponent. Jorah matches the spearman, is knocked over, but catches the spear before it reaches his throat. He gets back up and the two face off again. Jorah spins, somersaults, and stabs him through the stomach, killing him. He looks up to Daenerys. Jorah reaches for his opponent’s spear. He picks it up and hurls it towards Daenerys’ seat. Daario rushes to protect Daenerys and everyone else gets out of the way. It connects with a Son of the Harpy. Cut to the crowd. Many audience members have put on Sons of the Harpy masks."
5064,3,8,DAARIO,"Protect your queen! The Sons of the Harpy start slitting the throats of former slaves and Unsullied in the crowd. Unsullied guards and Daario surround Daenerys and Missandei, fighting off the Harpys. Hizdahr starts running towards Daenerys."
5065,3,8,HIZDAHR,"Your Grace, Your Grace, come with me! I know a way out! I know a way-- Two Sons of the Harpy come up on Hizdahr from behind and stab him to death. They run at Daenerys. Daario takes one out, and Jorah comes up from the pit to take Hizdahr’s spot and take out the other. He offers his hand to Daenerys and she takes it. He leads her down to the pit with Daario and the Unsullied, leaving Tyrion and Missandei. A Harpy comes towards Missandei. Tyrion comes from behind, pulls him to his knees, and slits his throat. He leads her down to the pit."
5066,3,8,TYRION,"Stay close! Sons of the Harpy have began to rush the pit. Unsullied fight them off as Daenerys, Daario, and Jorah head towards a side exit."
5067,3,8,JORAH,"This way! They run through the exit, but a door swings shut. A Son of the Harpy steps out and Jorah kills him."
5068,3,8,DAARIO,"The other side, follow me! They rush towards the other side and join up with Tyrion and Missandei."
5069,3,8,DAARIO,"Protect your queen! Jorah, Daario, and the Unsullied form a ring around Missandei, Daenerys, and Tyrion in the center of the pit. Sons of the Harpy begin to rush from the other exit they were heading towards. They surround the ring, testing out the outer ring before they begin rushing. A few make it past the outer ring but are killed by Daario. Missandei and Daenerys join hands and Daenerys closes her eyes. A roar is heard in the distance. All of the Harpys look up. Drogon appears, breathing fire and circling the pit. The Sons run away from Daenerys to the edge of the pit. One charges at her and Drogon rips him apart. He breathes fire on 4-5 of them at a time before a spear hits his back. 2 more spears connect and he starts slowing down."
5070,3,8,DAENERYS,"Drogon! She takes a spear from his neck. He roars at her, but then closes his mouth. She slowly reaches to touch his nose. More spears are thrown at him by Sons of the Harpy and he turns to them and roars. Daario continues to fight off every Harpy that comes near her. Daenerys climbs onto Drogon’s back slowly."

5072,3,9,MELISANDRE,"The Lord of Light has made good on his promise, my king. His fires have melted the snows away. The way ahead is clear."
5073,3,9,STANNIS,We ride for Winterfell.
5074,3,9,MELISANDRE,And you will take it. The Lord has shown me Bolton banners burning. You will receive what is yours by right. Melisandre wraps her arms around Stannis. He brushes her off then exits the tent. She follows after him. INT. STANNIS’S CAMP Stannis walks by his men as they prepare for battle. One soldier approaches him.
5075,3,9,SOLDIER,Your Grace.
5076,3,9,STANNIS,Prepare to form up.
5077,3,9,SOLDIER,Your Grace. The soldier waits for a response from Stannis.
5078,3,9,STANNIS,Tell me.
5079,3,9,SOLDIER,The men. Many deserted before dawn.
5080,3,9,STANNIS,How many?
5081,3,9,SOLDIER,"Nearly half. All the sell-swords, with all the horses. Stannis is speechless. He looks to Melisandre who appears even more devastated than he . Another soldier comes up to Stannis. SOLDIER 2: Your Grace?"
5082,3,9,STANNIS,Speak up. It can’t be worse than mutiny. The man is silent. EXT. WOODS OUTSIDE STANNIS’S CAMP Stannis is led by his men to a tree. Stannis looks up and sees Selyse hanging from it. Stannis takes a long look but tries not to reveal his emotions.
5083,3,9,STANNIS,Cut her down. The men cut the noose and bring her to the ground.
5084,3,9,SOLDIER,Your Grace. The Lady Melisandre was just seen riding out of camp. Stannis seethes but says nothing.
5085,3,9,STANNIS,Get the men into marching formation. On to Winterfell. Stannis walks from the woods back to camp. INT. CASTLE BLACK - LIBRARY
5086,3,9,JON,"He raised his hands. And they all stood up at once. Tens of thousands of them, the biggest army in the world."
5087,3,9,SAM,So what are you gonna do?
5088,3,9,JON,I’m gonna hope they don’t learn how to climb the wall.
5089,3,9,SAM,"But… the Dragonglass? JON (shakes his head): No one’s ever getting that back, now. It wouldn’t have mattered anyway, unless we had a mountain of it. SAM (confused): But… you killed a White Walker."
5090,3,9,JON,With Longclaw. I saw them shatter steel axes like they were glass. But Longclaw…
5091,3,9,SAM,He’s made of Valyrian steel. How many Valyrian steel swords are left in the Seven Kingdoms?
5092,3,9,JON,Not enough. (pause) The first Lord Commander in history to sacrifice the lives of sworn Brothers to save the lives of Wildlings. How’s it feel to be friends with the most hated man in Castle Black? (smiles)
5093,3,9,SAM,You were friends with me when I first got here. And I wasn’t winning any elections back then.
5094,3,9,JON,Here’s to us then. Long may they sneer. Jon and Sam clink glasses and drink. Sam looks to Jon.
5095,3,9,JON,What?
5096,3,9,SAM,"I wanted to ask you something. To ask something of you. Send me, Gilly, and the baby to Oldtown so I can become a Maester. That’s what I’m meant to be, not this."
5097,3,9,JON,"I need you here, Sam. If you leave, who’s left to give me advice I trust?"
5098,3,9,SAM,"Well, there’s Edd. Jon gives Sam a look."
5099,3,9,SAM,"I’ll be more use to you as a Maester . More use to everyone now that Maester Aemon’s gone. The Citadel has the world’s greatest library. I’ll learn about history, strategy, healing. And other things. Things that will help when they come. Jon stares at Sam, saying nothing."
5100,3,9,SAM,"If Gilly stays here then she’ll die. And the baby that she named after me will die. And I’ll end up dying, too, trying to protect them. Which means that the last thing that I’ll see in this world will be the look in her eyes when I fail them. (pause) I’d rather see a thousand White Walkers than see that.

OUTSIDE OF WINTERFELL Stannis’s depleted army marches onto Winterfell. Stannis is at the front with flaming heart banners flying all around him. EXT. WINTERFELL -  COURTYARD The Bolton army is preparing for battle. INT. WINTERFELL - SANSA’S ROOM Sansa uses the device she previously picked up to unlock her door. She drops the device and then exits her tower with a hood on. EXT. WINTERFELL - COURTYARD Sansa walks by the Bolton men as they are preparing for battle. EXT. OUTSIDE OF WINTERFELL - HILL Podrick returns to he and Brienne’s camp with firewood and dead rabbits. He hears screaming then looks down to see Stannis’s army marching for Winterfell. He drops the wood and rabbits and sprints back to Brienne. Brienne is staring at the Broken Tower."

5115,3,9,SOLDIER,"There’s not going to be a siege, Your Grace. Stannis looks to the distance and sees the Bolton army racing towards him as they come over the top of a hill. EXT. WINTERFELL - BROKEN TOWER Sansa looks down at the ensuing battle from the top of the Broken Tower with a candle in the window. EXT. OUTSIDE OF WINTERFELL Stannis sees he the army approaching.

She walks away from the window. EXT. WINTERFELL - WOODS Pan across the ground to reveal all but one of Stannis’s men are slaughtered alongside various banners and shields with his sigil. Stannis hobbles away from these men, using his sword as a crutch. Two Bolton men arrive on horse and kill the lone survivor of Stannis’s men. They charge at Stannis, one slices his leg, but he kills them both with a dagger and sword then falls to the ground. Stannis leans onto a tree and groans. He looks down to his bleeding leg with a resigned look, then looks up to the sound of a horse riding."
5116,3,9,STANNIS,Bolton has women fighting for him. Cut up to Brienne of Tarth.
5117,3,9,BRIENNE,I do not fight for the Boltons. I’m Brienne of Tarth. I was Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon. I was there when he was murdered by a shadow with your face. You murdered him? With blood magic? Stannis is silent for a long moment.
5118,3,9,STANNIS,I did. Brienne approaches him and unsheathes her sword.
5119,3,9,BRIENNE,"In the name of Renly of House Baratheon, First of his Name, Rightful King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, and Protector of the Realm, I, Brienne of Tarth, sentence you to die. Do you have any last words?"
5120,3,9,STANNIS,"Go on, do your duty. Brienne unsheathes her sword, pulls it back, swings forward, and--"
5121,3,9,TO,EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD Ramsay plunges his sword into a survivor. Then he surveys the corpses on the battlefield.
5122,3,9,RAMSAY,"Looks like we’re done here. Ramsay heads back towards his horse but sees one of Stannis’s men is survive, and is attempting to crawl away."
5123,3,9,SURVIVOR,I surrender. I surrender!
5124,3,9,RAMSAY,"And I accept your surrender. Ramsay plunges his sword into the man then pulls it out and wipes the blood off. RAMSAY (to squire): Let’s head back. My wife must be lonely. Pan out to reveal the bodies on the battlefield. EXT. WINTERFELL - COURTYARD Sansa hurries through Winterfell with her hood on. She heads up the stairs, sees one of the Bolton men walking her way, and doubles back. EXT. WINTERFELL - BALCONY Sansa rushes through a door towards the exit. She finds Myranda and Theon waiting for her, with Myranda’s bow drawn."
5125,3,9,MYRANDA,My lady. I have come to escort you back to your chamber.
5126,3,9,THEON,Go with her. Please.
5127,3,9,SANSA,"I know what Ramsay is. I know what he’ll do to me. (looks to Theon) If I’m going to die, let it happen while there’s some of me left."
5128,3,9,MYRANDA,"Die? (lowers the bow) Who said anything about dying? You can’t die yet. Your father was Warden of the North, and Ramsay needs you. Though I suppose he doesn’t need all of you. Just the parts he’ll use to make his heir. Until you’ve given him a boy or two and he’s finished using them. (raises bow) He’s got incredible plans for those parts. So. Shall we wait for him to come back, or shall we begin now? Sansa says nothing."
5129,3,9,MYRANDA,"You’re leaving it to me? Good. Let’s begin. She draws her arrow back. Just as she goes to release it, Theon tackles her into a wall, causing the arrow to miss Sansa. They struggle for a moment."
5130,3,9,MYRANDA,"Stop! Stop! Theon throws her over the edge, killing her on impact. As Sansa and Theon go to the edge to inspect the body, a horn begins to blare."
5131,3,9,MAN,Open the gates! Bolton men return from the battle and ride through the gates to Winterfell.
5132,3,9,THEON,"He’s coming back. Theon grabs Sansa’s hand and leads her along the walls. They climb to the top of the wall and look down to see a pile of snow at the bottom. Theon offers his hand to Sansa, she takes it, and they leap off of the wall. INT. BRAAVOS - BROTHEL Meryn Trant looks to 3 young girls in front of him and tightens his grip on the stick in his hand. He walks behind the first one and whips her, she starts crying. He does the same to the second and she cries as well. He walks up to the third girl, whose face is hidden by her hair, and whips her in the back. She doesn’t react. He whips her harder in the side and doesn’t get a reaction. He whips her a third time across the face and the girl still doesn’t make a sound."
5133,3,9,MERYN,"I can see I have my work cut out for me.You two. Out. The two other girls flee the room. The third removes her hair to show an unknown face. Meryn punches her in the stomach. She falls to the ground doubled over. Meryn smiles but loses the smile when he sees she is reaching for something. The girl pulls off her face, revealing she is Arya, and leaps towards Trant, stabbing him in the eye. She stabs his other eye then gags him with his shirt as he screams. He grabs at her but she stabs him in the chest until he rolls on his side."
5134,3,9,ARYA,"You were the first person on my list, you know. For killing Syrio Forel, remember him? Probably not. I’ve gotten a few of the others. The Many Faced God stole a few more for me. I’m glad he left me you. Do you know who I am? Trant struggles to make a noise through the gag."
5135,3,9,ARYA,I can’t hear you. She stabs him in the stomach.
5136,3,9,ARYA,"You know who I am. I’m Arya Stark. A look of surprise comes across Trant’s face, he grunts, and then Arya stabs him in the back. She removes the gag."
5137,3,9,ARYA,Do you know who you are? Trant whimpers.
5138,3,9,ARYA,You’re no one. You’re nothing. She slowly slits his throat and he keels over. INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE - FACE ROOM Arya walks into the room holding the face of the girl she wore to the brothel. She returns it to where she took it from.
5139,3,9,JAQEN,A girl has taken a life. The wrong life.
5140,3,9,WAIF,I was right about her.
5141,3,9,JAQEN,You were.
5142,3,9,WAIF,You’re not ready. Not at all. The waif grabs Arya and holds her in front of Jaqen.
5143,3,9,JAQEN,That man’s life wasn’t yours to take. A girl stole from the Many Faced God. Now a debt is owed. Jaqen holds up the same vial he gave to Arya to give to the Thin Man. The waif holds Arya’s face up near the vial as she struggles.
5144,3,9,JAQEN,Only death can pay for life. Jaqen drinks the vial and then falls straight to the ground.
5145,3,9,ARYA,"No! No! No, you don’t die! Don’t die! (sobs)"
5146,3,9,WAIF,Why are you crying?
5147,3,9,ARYA,He was my friend.
5148,3,9,WAIF,No he wasn’t. Didn’t you listen to him? JAQEN (O.S.): He was no one. Arya turns to see a man looking identical to Jaqen standing behind her.
5149,3,9,ARYA,But if you’re… (looks to the Jaqen who drank the potion and is seemingly dead) Who’s this?
5150,3,9,JAQEN,"No one at all. Just as a girl should have been before she took a face from the hall. Arya reaches and pulls off the Jaqen face, revealing the face of an old man."
5151,3,9,JAQEN,The faces are for no one. Arya pulls off the old man face to reveal a younger man’s face.
5152,3,9,JAQEN,You are still someone. Arya pulls off the young man’s face to reveal a different old man.
5153,3,9,JAQEN,"And to someone… Arya pulls off multiple faces, revealing the face of multiple different men."
5154,3,9,JAQEN,...the faces are as good as poison. Arya pulls off the final face and sees her own face staring back at her.
5155,3,9,ARYA,I can’t see! Arya’s vision begins to blur until the screen goes black.
5156,3,9,ARYA,What’s happening?! What’s happening?! EXT. DORNE - DOCK Myrcella kisses Prince Doran. DORAN (to Jaime): I wish you a safe journey home.
5157,3,9,JAIME,Thank you. Doran looks to Ellaria and nods. She walks up to Myrcella.
5158,3,9,ELLARIA,"Forgive me child. I wish you all the happiness in the world. Ellaria kisses Myrcella on the lips, holding the kiss then rubbing her lips. She nods to Jaime and Jaime nods back. Jaime helps Myrcella into the boat."
5159,3,9,BRONN,Maybe I’ll come visit you sometime.
5160,3,9,TYENE,Maybe I’ll come visit you.
5161,3,9,BRONN,"Don’t wait too long. I’ve a noble woman to marry back home. TYENE (leans in): You want a good girl, but you need the bad pussy. (bites his ear) JAIME (to Bronn): Whenever you’re ready, My Lord. Bronn nods to Tyene and the Snakes, then heads to the boat. INT. SEA OF DORNE - BOAT Myrcella looks down at her lion necklace."
5162,3,9,JAIME,Try not to lose it this time.
5163,3,9,MYRCELLA,I’ll never take it off again.
5164,3,9,JAIME,I know you didn’t want to leave Dorne. But I’m glad you’re coming home. Your mother’s desperate to see you. And I’m glad Trystane’s coming with us. He seems like a nice boy. You’re lucky. Arranged marriages are rarely so… so well arranged.
5165,3,9,MYRCELLA,Do you think mother will like him.
5166,3,9,JAIME,"If she sees you’re happy, I’m sure she will. MYRCELLA (laughing): And you really believe that? JAIME (smiles): Have you ever known your mother to like anyone aside from her children?"
5167,3,9,MYRCELLA,She likes you.
5168,3,9,JAIME,"I’m not so sure about that. Listen. There’s something I’ve wanted to tell you. Something I should have told you long ago. So. Now that you’ve seen more of the world, you’ve learned how complicated things can be. People can be. The Lannisters and the Martells have hated each other for years, but you’ve fallen in love with Trystane. It was an accident, really, I mean what were the chances? You happen to fall in love with the man you were assigned to marry? (Myrcella laughs) My point is… we don’t choose whom we love. We just… It’s beyond our control. I sound like an idiot."
5169,3,9,MYRCELLA,No you don’t.
5170,3,9,JAIME,What I’m trying to say. What I’m trying and failing to say…
5171,3,9,MYRCELLA,I know what you’re trying to say.
5172,3,9,JAIME,No. I’m afraid you don’t. Myrcella stands up and looks Jaime in the eyes.
5173,3,9,MYRCELLA,I do. She takes his good hand in hers.
5174,3,9,MYRCELLA,"I know. About you and mother. I think a part of me always knew. And I’m glad. I’m glad that you’re my father. Jaime looks shocked but happy. They embrace. She releases the hug and smiles at Jaime, with blood beginning to trickle out her nose."
5175,3,9,JAIME,Myrcella? The bleeding gets worse.
5176,3,9,JAIME,"Myrcella?! Myrcella collapses in Jaime’s arms, blood streaming down her face."
5177,3,9,JAIME,Myrcella?! Myrcella?!
5178,3,9,TO,"EXT. DORNE - DOCK Ellaria stares at Jaime’s ship from the dock. Blood begins to trickle out of her nose and splatter the floor. Tyene hands her a rag for the blood and she wipes it away then thrrows the rag away. She opens the antidote and drinks it down. She and the Sand Snakes begin walking from the dock. INT. MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID Tyrion, Daario, and Jorah sit on the steps in Dany’s throne room. TYRION (to Jorah): You love her, don’t you? How could you not. Of course, it’s hopeless for the both of you. Sellsword from the fighting pits, a disgraced knight. Neither one of you is fit consort for a queen. But, we always want the wrong woman."
5179,3,9,DAARIO,"Does he always talk so much? Jorah nods. Missandei brings Grey Worm into the room, with bandages around his torso."
5180,3,9,WORM,Jorah the Andal.
5181,3,9,JORAH,Torgo Nudho.
5182,3,9,WORM,You should not be here.
5183,3,9,DAARIO,"No, but he is."
5184,3,9,WORM,Our queen ordered him exiled from city.
5185,3,9,DAARIO,Our queen would be dead if not for him. MISSANDEI (Valyrian): It’s true. And I would be dead if not for the… (look at Tyrion) little man. TYRION (Valyrian): Dwarf. I believe that’s the word. Apologies. My Valyrian is a bit “nostril”.
5186,3,9,MISSANDEI,(Valyrian) A bit “rusty”.
5187,3,9,TYRION,(Valyrian) “Rusty” (Common Tongue) Thank you.
5188,3,9,WORM,I am sorry. Sorry I am not there to fight for my queen.
5189,3,9,DAARIO,You missed a good scrap.
5190,3,9,JORAH,None of that matters now. The longer we sit here bantering the longer Daenerys is out there in the wilderness.
5191,3,9,TYRION,"He’s right. The dragon headed north. If we’re going to find her, that’s where we’re to go."
5192,3,9,JORAH,We? You’re a Lannister. The Queen intends to remove your family from power.
5193,3,9,TYRION,And I intend to help her do it.
5194,3,9,JORAH,You’ve been here for how many days now? I’ve fought for her for years. Since she was little more than a child.
5195,3,9,TYRION,You betrayed her!
5196,3,9,JORAH,Careful now.
5197,3,9,TYRION,"And she exiled you, twice, I believe?"
5198,3,9,JORAH,The second time thanks to you.
5199,3,9,TYRION,"Don’t blame me for your crimes, Mormont."
5200,3,9,DAARIO,"(gestures to Tyrion) He’s right. The Queen exiled Jorah. (gestures to Jorah) And he’s right, Jorah saved her life. Perhaps she feels differently about him now. Perhaps not. The only way we’ll know is if we ask her."
5201,3,9,TYRION,"Fine, fine, I suppose he can join us. Just as long as he promises not to kill me in my sleep."
5202,3,9,JORAH,"If I ever kill you your eyes will be wide open. DAARIO (to Tyrion): Forgive me, but why would we bring you?"
5203,3,9,TYRION,Pardon me?
5204,3,9,DAARIO,Have you ever tracked animals in the wilderness?
5205,3,9,TYRION,"Not precisely, but I have other skills that’d be very useful--"
5206,3,9,DAARIO,Can you fight?
5207,3,9,TYRION,I have fought. I don’t claim to be a great warrior.
5208,3,9,DAARIO,Are you good on a horse?
5209,3,9,TYRION,Middling.
5210,3,9,DAARIO,So mainly you talk?
5211,3,9,TYRION,And drink. I’ve survived so far.
5212,3,9,DAARIO,"Which I respect. But you would not help us on this expedition. You would help us here in Meereen, though. (to Missandei, Grey Worm, and Jorah) None of us have any experience governing a city, except for him. You want to prove your value to the queen? Prove it right here in Meereen."
5213,3,9,JORAH,He’s a foreign dwarf that barely speaks the language. Why would the Meereenese listen to him?
5214,3,9,DAARIO,They wouldn’t. They will listen to Grey Worm.
5215,3,9,WORM,I’ll come with you. I’ll find our queen.
5216,3,9,MISSANDEI,You are not strong enough to go anywhere.
5217,3,9,WORM,I am.
5218,3,9,DAARIO,"He is, he’s the toughest man with no balls I’ve ever met. But you still can’t go. The people believe in you. They know you speak for the queen."
5219,3,9,MISSANDEI,"It’s true. Only the Unsullied can keep the peace in Meereen. If you leave, half the city will consume the other half."
5220,3,9,DAARIO,"And Missandei. Our queen trusts no one more than Missandei. Certainly not me. The queen’s closest confidant, the commander of the Unsullied, and the foreign dwarf with the scarred face. Good fortune, my friends, Meereen is ancient and glorious. (to Tyrion) Try not to ruin her. (to Jorah) Looks like it’s you and me, Jorah the Andal. Let’s find some good horses. We have so much to talk about. Tyrion walks down the steps towards Missandei and Grey Worm. They exchange uncertain glances with each other. EXT. MEEREEN - BALCONY Tyrion stands in the place where Dany had Mossador executed and watches Jorah and Daario ride out of the city. VOICE (O.S.): Hello, old friend. Tyrion turns to see Varys on the balcony next to him."
5221,3,9,VARYS,I thought we were so happy together until you abandoned me.
5222,3,9,TYRION,I suppose there’s no point in asking how you found me.
5223,3,9,VARYS,"The birds sing in the west, the birds sing in the east. If one knows how to listen. They tell me you’ve already found favor with the Mother of Dragons."
5224,3,9,TYRION,"Well, she didn’t execute me, so that’s a promising start. Now the heroes are off to find her, and I’m stuck here, trying to placate a city on the brink of civil war. Any advice for an old comrade?"
5225,3,9,VARYS,Information is the key. You need to learn your enemies’ strengths and strategies. You need to learn which of your friends are not your friends.
5226,3,9,TYRION,If only I knew someone with a vast network of spies.
5227,3,9,VARYS,"If only. (beat) A grand old city, choking on violence, corruption, and deceit. Who could possibly have any experience managing such a massive, ungainly beast? Tyrion looks up to Varys with a slight smile."
5228,3,9,TYRION,I did miss you.
5229,3,9,VARYS,"Oh, I know. EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - PLATEAU Dany looks to Drogon who is lying down in a ring full of bones."
5230,3,9,DAENERYS,We have to go home. Drogon lies down and grunts.
5231,3,9,DAENERYS,"My poor, sweet thing. Does it hurt? (pause) We have to go home. Drogon? Can you take me back to Meereen? Daenerys pets his nose but gets no response."
5232,3,9,DAENERYS,How far did you carry me? (surveys the area) Drogon begins turning away from her to lick at his wounds.
5233,3,9,DAENERYS,"Drogon, we need to return. My people need me. She climbs back on his back, but he hisses and bucks her off, then goes to sleep."
5234,3,9,DAENERYS,"Well, there’s no food. At the very least you can hunt us some supper. Dany begins walking across the plateau to explore. A horse gallops in the distance. Camera cuts to reveal the pony-tail of a Dothraki. Three more Dothraki men arrive on horseback. Daenerys drops her ring to the ground. Another group of Dothraki arrives, and then the rest of the khalasar. They begin circling around Daenerys, howling. INT. CERSEI’S CELL Cersei is huddled in the corner. She shudders as the door opens."
5235,3,9,SEPTA,Confess. Confess. Cersei looks up to the Septa. INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - HIGH SPARROW’S ROOM Cersei is knelt before the High Sparrow in the room where she was taken away.
5236,3,9,CERSEI,"I have sinned. I see that now. How could I have been so blind for so long. I want to be clean again. I want absolution. The Crone came to me with her lamp raised high, and with its holy light--"
5237,3,9,SPARROW,You wish to make a confession?
5238,3,9,CERSEI,"Once I’ve confessed, will I be free?"
5239,3,9,SPARROW,Your Grace will be dealt with according to her sins.
5240,3,9,CERSEI,"The Mother have mercy then. I lay with a man outside the bonds of marriage, I confess."
5241,3,9,SPARROW,Name him.
5242,3,9,CERSEI,Lancel Lannister.
5243,3,9,SPARROW,Your cousin. And the King’s squire.
5244,3,9,CERSEI,I was lonely and afraid.
5245,3,9,SPARROW,You had a husband.
5246,3,9,CERSEI,A husband of whoring every chance he got.
5247,3,9,SPARROW,His sins do not pardon your own.
5248,3,9,CERSEI,May the gods forgive me.
5249,3,9,SPARROW,Other men?
5250,3,9,CERSEI,No.
5251,3,9,SPARROW,No others?
5252,3,9,CERSEI,No.
5253,3,9,SPARROW,Speaking falsehoods before the Gods is a great crime. You understand this?
5254,3,9,CERSEI,I do.
5255,3,9,SPARROW,There are those who say your children were not fathered by King Robert. That they are bastards born of incest and adultery.
5256,3,9,CERSEI,"A lie. A lie from the lips of Stannis Baratheon. He wants the Throne, but his brother’s children stand in his way, so he claims they are not his brothers’. The filth. There is not one shred of truth to it. I deny it."
5257,3,9,SPARROW,"Good. But these are terrible charges. And the realm must know the truth of them. If Your Grace has given honest testimony, your trial will prove your innocence."
5258,3,9,CERSEI,Trial? I have confessed?
5259,3,9,SPARROW,To a single sin. Others you have denied. Your trial will separate the truths from the falsehoods.
5260,3,9,CERSEI,I bow to the wisdom of your High Holiness. But if I might beg for just one drop of the Mother’s mercy. I haven’t seen my son… I don’t know how long it’s been. I need to see him. Please.
5261,3,9,SPARROW,"You have taken the first step on a path back to righteousness. In light of this, I will permit you to return to the Red Keep."
5262,3,9,CERSEI,Thank you. Thank you.
5263,3,9,SPARROW,The Mother is merciful. It is her you should thank.
5264,3,9,CERSEI,"I will, I will. I swear it, day and night."
5265,3,9,SPARROW,Good.
5266,3,9,CERSEI,Am I free to go?
5267,3,9,SPARROW,After your atonement.
5268,3,9,CERSEI,"My atonement? INT. CERSEI’S CELL Cersei is stripped naked and has the dirt washed off of her by the septas. After they scrub her clean, they sit her down and begin chopping her hair away with a knife. They leave her naked, with short hair and a bloody scalp, and then shut the door on her. EXT. KING’S LANDING - GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR Cersei is carried to the top of the steps, in front of a massive crowd of King’s Landing citizens."
5269,3,9,SPARROW,"A sinner comes before you. Cersei of House Lannister, mother to his Grace King Tommen, widow to his Grace King Robert. She has committed the acts of falsehood and fornication. She has confessed her sins and begged for forgiveness. To demonstrate her repentance, she will cast aside all pride, all artifice, and present herself as the gods made her, to you. The good people of the city. She comes before you with a solemn heart. Shorn of secrets. Naked before the eyes of gods and men. To make her walk of atonement. The septas remove her robe. She stands naked before the citizens of King’s Landing, who gasp. They force her to start walking down the stairs."
5270,3,9,SEPTA,"Shame. Shame. Shame. (rings bell) The septa repeats “Shame. Shame. Shame.” and rings the bell through the duration of Cersei’s walk. Cersei is escorted by the Sparrows through the crowd of people. Silence at first, but once one man yells “Cunt!”, she begins to be heckled."
5271,3,9,CROWD,Bitch! Whore! All hail her royal tits! They begin pelting her with food. A prostitute runs in front of Cersei with her breasts out.
5272,3,9,WOMAN,I’ve had half as many cocks as the queen! The sparrows force her out of Cersei’s way. A man with his penis out runs in front of her later in the walk.
5273,3,9,MAN,"Suck me off! Suck me off, you bitch! As Cersei approaches the end of her walk things get more violent. A man spits directly in her face, and a Sparrow has to beat a woman with a club as she charges Cersei. She is knocked to her knees at the end of her walk, but gets back to her feet when she sees the Red Keep in the distance. She finally reaches the end of the walk of atonement, and enters the Red Keep, sobbing. INT. RED KEEP Kevan Lannister, Grand Maester Pycelle, Qyburn, and the Lannister guards wait for her. Qyburn rushes to cover her naked body with a blanket as Cersei begins weeping."
5274,3,9,QYBURN,Your Grace. It’s good to have you back. Come. We’ll take you inside. I need to have a look at those feet. Cut to her bloody feet. We hear two giant footsteps off screen.
5275,3,9,QYBURN,"May I have the honor of presenting the newest member of the Kingsguard. A hulking man, who is revealed to have a blue face through the eye holes in his helm, walks over to Qyburn and Cersei. He takes Cersei in his arms."
5276,3,9,QYBURN,"If it please Your Grace, he’s taken a holy vow of silence. He has sworn that he will not speak until all his Grace’s enemies are dead, and the evil has been driven from the realm. EXT. CASTLE BLACK Jon and Davos exit the elevator."
5277,3,9,DAVOS,He came to your aid. Stannis. Now he needs you!
5278,3,9,JON,We don’t have enough men to make any difference.
5279,3,9,DAVOS,The wildlings will make a difference!
5280,3,9,JON,"The wildlings won’t ever fight for Stannis, I told you before--"
5281,3,9,DAVOS,"You saved their bloody lives. If they’re going to live in the Seven Kingdoms, safe behind our wall, they ought to fight for the damn place."
5282,3,9,JON,"It’s not their fight! The gates to Castle Black are opened and Melisandre arrives, alone and on horseback. Jon and Davos rush over to her."
5283,3,9,JON,Stannis? No response.
5284,3,9,DAVOS,Shireen? The princess? A long look but no response. Melisandre walks away from the two of them. INT. CASTLE BLACK - JON’S ROOM Jon goes through the various scrolls on his desk. Olly enters the room.
5285,3,9,OLLY,Lord Commander. It’s one of the wildlings you brought back. Says he knows your Uncle Benjen. Says he’s still alive. JON (stands up): Are you sure he’s talking about Benjen?
5286,3,9,OLLY,Says he was first Ranger. Said he knows where to find him. Jon rushes out of his room down to the ground. He is met by Alliser.
5287,3,9,ALLISER,Man says he saw your uncle at Hardhome the last full moon.
5288,3,9,JON,He could be lying.
5289,3,9,ALLISER,Could be. There are ways to find out.
5290,3,9,JON,Where is he?
5291,3,9,ALLISER,"Over there. Jon walks past a group of Brothers holding torches. He sees a sign that reads “TRAITOR” when he passes them, and turns to see he is cornered. Alliser stabs him in the gut."
5292,3,9,ALLISER,For the Watch. Another Brother stabs him.
5293,3,9,BROTHER,For the Watch. A third Brother stabs him.

5315,4,0,THORNE,"We’ve committed treason, all of us . Jon Snow was my Lord Commander . I had no love for him . That was no secret . But I never once disobeyed an order . Loyalty is the foundation on which the Night’s Watch is built, and the Watch means everything to me . I have given my life, we have all given our lives to the Night’s Watch . Jon Snow was going to destroy the Night’s Watch . He let the wildlings through our gates, as no Lord Commander has ever done before .

5338,4,0,ROOSE,"I rebelled against the crown to arrange your marriage to Sansa Stark . Do you think that burning wagons in the night and mowing down tired, outnumbered Baratheons is the same as facing a prepared and provisioned Lannister army?"

5359,4,0,THEON,She broke her leg jumping from the ramparts . I left her to die in the snow . The dogs catch SANSA’s scent and begin barking. They lead the soldiers to SANSA under the roots of the tree. SANSA cowers from them.
5360,4,0,OFFICER,I can’t wait to see what parts Ramsay cuts off you this time . One of the soldiers grabs SANSA and pulls her to her feet. A horse whinnies in the distance. The soldiers draw their weapons. BRIENNE and PODRICK ride towards the soldiers with their sword drawn.
5361,4,0,OFFICER,"It’s a bloo dy woman . BRIENNE cuts down BOLTON OFFICER as she rides past. PODRICK engages one of the soldiers in mounted combat. BRIENNE faces off with another mounted soldier.

She retrieves the blade again and stands, engaging him in a swordfight. She cuts him down. A mounted soldier charges at BRIENNE. She jumps and strikes him, causing his horse to fall over, trapping him beneath it. While PODRICK continues his mounted sword fight, THEON grabs the blade of a fallen soldier off the ground. PODRICK cuts down the soldier he is fighting and they both fall from their horses. Another soldier advances on PODRICK, and they begin fighting. BRIENNE crawls over to the man trapped beneath his horse and slits his throat with a dagger. The soldier PODRICK is fighting knocks PODRICK’s sword out of his hand. PODRICK falls to the ground. Just before the soldier is about to strike PODRICK, THEON stabs the soldier from behind. PODRICK stands up. BRIENNE walks over to SANSA. SANSA stands up to confront her. BRIENNE places her blade on the ground in front of SANSA and kneels before her."

VISERION lights a fire in his mouth and roars at TYRION. RHAEGAL approaches with a small roar. TYRION (to RHAEGAL): I’m friends with your mother . I’m here to help . Don’t eat the help . TYRION chuckles nervously. RHAEGAL growls at TYRION. TYRION approaches cautiously."
5638,4,1,TYRION,"When I was a child an uncle asked what gift I wanted for my name day . I begged him for one of you . “It wouldn’t even have to be a big dragon,” I told him . “It could be little, like me . ” TYRION sets down his torch and gets closer to RHAEGAL."
5639,4,1,TYRION,Everyone laughed like it was the funniest thing they had ever heard . Then my father told me the last dragon had died a century ago . I cried myself to sleep that night . TYRION touches RHAEGAL on the neck.
5640,4,1,TYRION,But here you are . TYRION takes hold of the piston keeping RHAEGAL’s shackle closed and pulls it free. The shackle falls the ground. TYRION turns around to see VISERION growling at him. VISERION exposes his neck to TYRION. TYRION approaches and releases the piston from VISERION’s shackle. RHAEGAL and VISERION return to the shadows. TYRION picks up his torch and hurries up the steps.

ARYA stands up and swings at the WAIF again, and misses for a third time. The WAIF hits ARYA in the face, knocking her to the ground again. ARYA is panting heavily. She returns to her feet, screams, and swings her staff around her many times. The WAIF has disappeared. The Faceless Man, taking on the visage of JAQEN H’GHAR, catches ARYA’s staff mid-swing."

5664,4,1,RAMSAY,"So was I, Father ."
5665,4,1,KARSTARK,Your hold on the North will never be secure as long as a Stark can walk through that door .
5666,4,1,RAMSAY,"Castle Black isn’t defended on the southern side . And the few men left are barely men at all. Farm boys and thieves . With a small force we could storm the castle, kill Jon Snow --"
5667,4,1,ROOSE,Murder the Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch? You’d unite every house in the North against us .
5668,4,1,RAMSAY,"We don’t need every house in the North. The Umbers, the Manderlys, and the Karstarks . command more soldiers than all the other houses combined . With their support, none could challenge us ."
5669,4,1,KARSTARK,The Starks lost my house the day King Rob cut off my father’s head . It’s time for new blood in the North . ROOSE looks at both his son and lord Karstark. He gets up and stands in front of them.

5677,4,1,RAMSAY,How did he die ?

5692,4,1,WALDA,Where is Lord Bolton ? The dogs bark even louder. RAMSAY (to the dogs): Down ! The baby starts crying. LADY WALDA tries to soothe the baby.

5694,4,1,WALDA,"It’s cold out here, Ramsay . I need to feed him . RAMSAY opens the doors of all the kennels one by one."

5703,4,1,BRIENNE,She looked good . She wasn’t exactly dressed like a lady . SANSA smiles.
5704,4,1,SANSA,"No, she wouldn’t be ."
5705,4,1,BRIENNE,What happened at Winterfell ? SANSA pauses and tears up.
5706,4,1,SANSA,I should’ve gone with you while I had the chance .
5707,4,1,BRIENNE,"It was a difficult choice, my lady . BRIENNE looks at THEON."
5708,4,1,BRIENNE,We’ve all had to make difficult choices . THEON stands up and walks away from PODRICK. SANSA stands and walks to THEON.
5709,4,1,THEON,We shouldn’t be lighting fires . It’s not safe . He won’t stop hunting us .
5710,4,1,SANSA,"We just have to make it to Castle Black . Once we’re with Jon, Ramsay won’t be able to touch us ."

5713,4,1,THEON,"And the truth about the farm boys I killed in their place ? The truth about Ser Rodrik, who I beheaded ? SANSA looks to the ground."
5714,4,1,THEON,"And the truth about Rob, who I betrayed ?"

5721,4,1,THEON,Home . EXT. PYKE CASTLE - NIGHT A storm is raging.
5722,4,1,TO,PYKE CASTLE - GREAT HALL YARA and BALON are standing and speaking. BALON stands at the fireplace with his back to YARA.
5723,4,1,YARA,The Glovers have retaken Deepwood Motte .
5724,4,1,BALON,And the Ironborn who held it ?
5725,4,1,YARA,They died fighting to a man .
5726,4,1,BALON,What is dead may never die .
5727,4,1,YARA,What is dead may never die . YARA places the piece of paper she was reading from on a table.
5728,4,1,YARA,But they did and our invasion died with them . Deepwood Motte was our last stronghold on the mainland .
5729,4,1,BALON,They we will take more .
5730,4,1,YARA,Why? For more pinecones and rocks ? BALON turns around to face YARA.
5731,4,1,BALON,Because I order it .
5732,4,1,YARA,"We can defeat anyone at sea, but we’ll never hold lands and castles against mainland armies . BALON walks to YARA."
5733,4,1,BALON,"Not if our captains defy my orders, abandon their posts, and sacrifice our men on foolish mission ."
5734,4,1,YARA,I won’t apologize for trying to rescue Theon .
5735,4,1,BALON,Then where is he ?
5736,4,1,YARA,"Where is your kingdom ? We took those castles because the northerners marched off to war . That war is over . The last time we provoked them too far, I watched from that window as they breached our walls and knocked down our towers . I lost two brothers that day ."
5737,4,1,BALON,"And I lost three sons . The War of the Five Kings, they call it . Well, the other four are dead . When you rule the Iron Islands, you can wage all the peace you wan. But for now, shut your mouth and obey or I will make another heir who will . BALON exits the hall."
5738,4,1,TO,"PYKE CASTLE - BRIDGE Rain is pouring down. BALON begins to cross the unsteady bridge. He leans on the ropes and looks down at the ocean, then sees a cloaked figure on the other side of the bridge."
5739,4,1,BALON,"Let me pass. You fool, move aside for your king."
5740,4,1,FIGURE,"Haven’t I always, brother? The hooded figure takes off his hood, revealing his identity. He is EURON GREYJOY. BALON walks a few steps closer."
5741,4,1,BALON,I thought you’d be rotting under some foreign sea by now .
5742,4,1,EURON,What is dead may never die . BALON does not respond.
5743,4,1,EURON,Has the custom changed since I’ve been gone? Aren’t you supposed to repeat the words?
5744,4,1,BALON,You can mock our god without my help .
5745,4,1,EURON,"I don’t mock the Drowned God . I am the Drowned God . From Oldtown to Qarth, when men see my sails, they pray . The wind buffets the bridge back and forth. BALON tries to hold his balance. EURON chuckles."
5746,4,1,EURON,"You’re old, brother . You've had your time . Now let another rule . BALON walks towards his brother."
5747,4,1,BALON,I heard you lost your mind during the storm on the Jade Sea . They tied you to the mast to keep you from jumping overboard .
5748,4,1,EURON,They did .
5749,4,1,BALON,"And when the storm passed, you cut out their tongues ."
5750,4,1,EURON,I needed silence .
5751,4,1,BALON,What kind of an Ironborn loses his senses during a storm ?
5752,4,1,EURON,"I am the storm, brother . The first storm and the last . And you’re in my way . BALON draws a knife and slashes EURON across the face. EURON throws BALON off the bridge. BALON falls to his death."
5753,4,1,TO,"PYKE ISLAND BEACH - DAY Many Ironborn are in attendance for BALON's funeral. AERON GREYJOY and several Drowned Men are gathered around BALON's body. They are performing funeral rites, covering it with rocks, seaweed, and wood. YARA approaches. YARA and the Drowned Men walk BALON's body through the shallows."
5754,4,1,AERON,"Lord, take your servant Balon back beneath the waves . Feed the creatures of your kingdom on his flesh . Pull his bones down to your depths to rest beside his ancestors and his children ."
5755,4,1,ALL,What is dead may never die .
5756,4,1,YARA,I’m going to find out who did this . I’m going to feed them to the sharks while they live . I swear it by the Salt Throne .
5757,4,1,AERON,"The Salt Throne is not yours to swear upon, not unless the kingsmoot chooses you ."
5758,4,1,YARA,My father would’ve wanted me to rule .
5759,4,1,AERON,Your father does not get to choose . The law is clear . Perhaps you'll win . Perhaps you’ll be the first woman in history to rule the Ironborn . And perhaps not . INT. CASTLE BLACK - MELISANDRE’S CHAMBER MELISANDRE is sitting at the fireplace. Someone knocks on the door.

5762,4,1,MELISANDRE,You interrupt nothing . DAVOS looks at the fireplace and then at MELISANDRE.
5763,4,1,DAVOS,I assume you know why I’m here .
5764,4,1,MELISANDRE,I will after you tell me .
5765,4,1,DAVOS,It’s about the Lord Commander .
5766,4,1,MELISANDRE,The former Lord Commander .
5767,4,1,DAVOS,Does he have to be? MELISANDRE looks at DAVOS.
5768,4,1,MELISANDRE,What are you asking ?
5769,4,1,DAVOS,Do you know of any magic ... that could help him? Bring him back?
5770,4,1,MELISANDRE,"If you want to help him, leave him be ."
5771,4,1,DAVOS,Can it be done ?
5772,4,1,MELISANDRE,There are some with his power .
5773,4,1,DAVOS,How ?
5774,4,1,MELISANDRE,I don’t know .
5775,4,1,DAVOS,Have you seen it done ?
5776,4,1,MELISANDRE,"I met a man who came back from the dead, but the priest who did it -- It shouldn’t have been possible ."
5777,4,1,DAVOS,But it was . It could be now .
5778,4,1,MELISANDRE,Not for me . MELISANDRE stands and walks away from her chair. DAVOS walks towards her.
5779,4,1,DAVOS,Not for you? I saw you drink poison that should’ve killed you . I saw you give birth to a demon made of shadows .
5780,4,1,MELISANDRE,"Everything I believed, the great victory I saw in the flames, all of it was a lie . MELISANDRE looks at DAVOS."
5781,4,1,MELISANDRE,You were right all along . The Lord never spoke to me .
5782,4,1,DAVOS,"Fuck him, then . Fuck all of them . I’m not a devout man, obviously . Seven Gods, drowned gods, tree gods, it's all the same . DAVOS comes a step closer to MELISANDRE"
5783,4,1,DAVOS,I’m not asking the Lord of Light for help . I’m asking the woman who showed me that miracles exist .
5784,4,1,MELISANDRE,I never had this gift .
5785,4,1,DAVOS,Have you ever tried?

5842,4,2,NED,The Mad King is dead . Rhaegar lies beneath the ground . Why weren’t you there to protect your prince?
5843,4,2,ARTHUR,Our prince wanted us here .
5844,4,2,NED,Where’s my sister?
5845,4,2,ARTHUR,I wish you good fortune in the wars to come . ARTHUR and the other Kingsguard put on their helmets.
5846,4,2,ARTHUR,And now it begins . The Kingsguard draw their blades.
5847,4,2,NED,"No . Now it ends . NED and his men draw their blades and attack. ARTHUR cuts down HOWLAND. The other Kingsguard runs one of NED’s men through with his sword. NED engages in single combat with the other Kingsguard and stabs him through the throat. NED and his three remaining men surround ARTHUR. NED and his men attack all at once, but ARTHUR deflects all of their blows repeatedly, then repositions himself. He kills one of NED’s men with a downward strike from both of his blades. NED and the two remaining men advance on ARTHUR. ARTHUR deflects their blows again and slices the throat of another man, then runs another through with his blade. NED engages ARTHUR in single combat."
5848,4,2,BRAN,He’s better than my father .
5849,4,2,RAVEN,Far better .
5850,4,2,BRAN,But Father beat him .
5851,4,2,RAVEN,Did he?
5852,4,2,BRAN,"I know he did . Heard the story a thousand times . ARTHUR traps NED’s blade and wrenches it from his hands. ARTHUR makes a motion to strike NED down, but HOWLAND stabs ARTHUR in the back. ARTHUR falls to his knees."
5853,4,2,BRAN,"He stabbed him in the back . NED retrieves a sword and slashes ARTHUR with it, killing him. A woman screams from the Tower and NED storms towards it."
5854,4,2,BRAN,What’s in the tower?
5855,4,2,RAVEN,That’s enough for one day . We’ll visit again another time .
5856,4,2,BRAN,I want to see where he’s going .
5857,4,2,RAVEN,Time to go .
5858,4,2,BRAN,"Father! NED stops on the stairs and turns around in the direction of BRAN’s yelling but sees nothing and proceeds up the stairs. BRAN chases after him but is intercepted by the THREE-EYED RAVEN, who touches him on the shoulder."
5859,4,2,TO,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE The white leaves BRAN’s eyes as the vision fades. The THREE-EYED RAVEN is tangled in his roots. A child of the forest looks on. BRAN crawls towards the THREE-EYED RAVEN.
5860,4,2,BRAN,Why did you do that? Take me back there . I want to go back .
5861,4,2,RAVEN,No .
5862,4,2,BRAN,He heard me .
5863,4,2,RAVEN,Maybe . Maybe he heard the wind .
5864,4,2,BRAN,He heard me .
5865,4,2,RAVEN,The past is already written . The ink is dry .
5866,4,2,BRAN,What’s in that tower? I want to go back there .
5867,4,2,RAVEN,"I’ve told you many times, stay too long where you don’t belong and you will never return ."
5868,4,2,BRAN,Why do I want to return? So I can be a cripple again? So I can talk to an old man in a tree?
5869,4,2,RAVEN,"You think I wanted to sit here for 1,000 years watching the world from a distance as the roots grew through me?"
5870,4,2,BRAN,So why did you?
5871,4,2,RAVEN,I was waiting for you .
5872,4,2,BRAN,I don’t want to be you .
5873,4,2,RAVEN,"I don’t blame you . You won’t be here forever . You won’t be an old man in a tree . But before you leave, you must learn ."
5874,4,2,BRAN,Learn what?
5875,4,2,RAVEN,"Everything . EXT. VAES DOTHRAK - DAY DAENERYS is entering Vaes Dothrak with the horde. A mounted Bloodrider ushers her onward with a nudge of his foot. BLOODRIDER (speaking Dothraki): Hey, Great Khaleesi . Move your ass . DAENERYS approaches a domed structure. KHAL MORO and two of his Bloodriders are waiting for atop their horses."
5876,4,2,MORO,"Welcome home, Khaleesi . Another Bloodrider ushers DAENERYS into the building. Inside, DAENERYS stands in front of a platform atop which a middle-aged Dothraki woman is standing. A group of younger Dothraki women encircle DAENERYS. They speak in Dothraki."
5877,4,2,WOMAN,"Go . The Bloodriders who ushered DAENERYS in exit. The older Dothraki woman nods to the younger women, who swarm DAENERYS and remove all of her clothing."
5878,4,2,DAENERYS,"What are you doing?! Take your hands off me! I will have your heads! One of the younger woman approaches DAENERYS with a simple brown garment, which DAENERYS takes and wears."
5879,4,2,DAENERYS,You have made a mistake . One you will regret . I am the wife of the Great Khal .
5880,4,2,MATRON,We know who you are . I remember you eating the stallion’s heart . Why didn’t you come to us after Khal Drogo died?
5881,4,2,DAENERYS,"Because I am Daenerys Stormborn, the Breaker of Chains, the Queen of Meereen and the Mother of Dragons . My place is not here with you ."
5882,4,2,MATRON,"You were the wife of the Great Khal . You thought he would conquer the world with you at his side . He didn’t . I was the wife of the Great Khal . Khal Savo . I thought he would conquer the world with me at his side . You’re young . We were all young once . But we all understand the way things are . You will learn as well, if you are fortunate enough to stay with us ."
5883,4,2,DAENERYS,Where else would I go? Every khaleesi becomes Dosh Khaleen .
5884,4,2,MATRON,"Yes . Immediately after the death of their khal . But you went out into the world . That is forbidden . All the khalasars have returned for the Khalar Vezhven . They will decide which cities will be sacked and which tribes will be enslaved . And now they must decide what to do with Khal Drogo’s silver-haired widow . With luck, your place will be here with us, Mother of Dragons . It is the best you can hope for, now . INT. MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM VARYS is sitting on the steps of the throne, fanning himself. Several Unsullied stand around the perimeters of the room. VARYS (to an Unsullied): I don’t know how you stand it in all that leather . Two Unsullied usher a woman into the room."
5885,4,2,VARYS,If we could have the room . All the Unsullied guards exit.
5886,4,2,VARYS,"You look lovely today, my dear . You really do . How you climbed all those steps without breaking a sweat ."
5887,4,2,WOMAN,"If you’re going to torture me, just call them back and get on with it ."
5888,4,2,VARYS,I am not a torturer . VARYS stands.
5889,4,2,VARYS,Though it so often is what people deserve . VARYS approaches the woman.
5890,4,2,VARYS,"And it does provide answers . But they’re usually the wrong answers . My job is to find the right answers . Do you know how I do that? I do it by making people happy . I’d like to make you happy, Vala . That’s your name, isn’t it, Vala? VALA looks away. VARYS chuckles."
5891,4,2,VARYS,"That’s all right . I know who you are and what you’ve done . You’ve done a lot . You’ve sacrificed your body for a cause, which is more than most people do . And you’ve helped the Sons of the Harpy murder the Unsullied and the Second Sons ."
5892,4,2,VALA,The Unsullied and the Second Songs are foreign soldiers brought here by a foreign queen to destroy our city and our history .
5893,4,2,VARYS,"I understand . Well, that makes perfect sense from your perspective . I have a different perspective, of course . I think it’s important that you try to see things from my perspective just as I will try to see them from yours . Because that is the only way that I can make you and Dom happy . That is how you pronounce it -- Dom? I’m afraid I don’t really speak the language . Such a handsome boy . Those big, brown eyes . Good luck keeping the ladies away ."
5894,4,2,VALA,"Yes, you’re a true liberator, aren’t you? You won’t torture me, you’ll just threaten my son ."
5895,4,2,VARYS,"Children are blameless . I have never hurt them . Your boy is in no immediate danger, this I swear to you . But between us, dear, you did conspire to kill the queen’s soldiers . We both know the penalty for that crime . How will poor Dom get on without his mother? And with his breathing problem ."
5896,4,2,VALA,"If I tell you anything, they’ll kill me . So either you kill me or they do ."
5897,4,2,VARYS,"Yes, from your perspective, this is a problem . There is a third option, though . A ship leaving tomorrow for Pentos . I’ve already booked passage for a woman and her young son . I’ll even throw in a bag of silver to help you start again . VARYS kicks a large brown bag at his feet."
5898,4,2,VARYS,Though I’m afraid we’ll have to ask one of our leather-clad friends back in to carry it . Far too heavy for me . The boat sails at dawn . You need to decide now . A new life for you and Dom or…
5899,4,2,TO,"MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID - COUNCIL CHAMBER TYRION, MISSANDEI, and GREY WORM are sitting together around a table. TYRION smiles at MISSANDEI, and MISSANDEI smiles back. TYRION smiles at GREY WORM, and GREY WORM remains expressionless."
5900,4,2,TYRION,"What should we do while we wait? To pass the time, what should we do? What should we talk about? MISSANDEI and GREY WORM look at each other, then at TYRION. TYRION (to MISSANDEI): You speak 19 languages . You must occasionally use some of them to talk about things . MISSANDEI says nothing."
5901,4,2,TYRION,"You two, you spend a great deal of time together . What would you be talking about if I weren’t here?"
5902,4,2,WORM,Patrol . When I am going on patrol with the Unsullied . What we see on patrol . Who we captured on patrol .
5903,4,2,TYRION,That’s good . That’s very good . TYRION stands and carries his wine glass over to the decanter to refill it.
5904,4,2,TYRION,But that’s a report . I was thinking more of a conversation . A wise man once said the truth history of the world is the history of great conversation in elegant rooms .
5905,4,2,MISSANDEI,Who said this?
5906,4,2,TYRION,"Me . Just now . All right, no conversations . Let’s play a game . TYRION returns to the table. GREY WORM and MISSANDEI say nothing."
5907,4,2,TYRION,"You don’t play games, either one of you, ever?"
5908,4,2,WORM,Games are for children .
5909,4,2,MISSANDEI,My master Kraznys would sometimes make us play games .
5910,4,2,TYRION,"There, that’s a start ."
5911,4,2,MISSANDEI,Only the girls .
5912,4,2,TYRION,"Oh no, no, no . Not that, of course not that . Innocent games, fun games, drinking games ."
5913,4,2,MISSANDEI,We do not drink .
5914,4,2,TYRION,Until you do . GREY WORM and MISSANDEI look interrogatively at TYRION.
5915,4,2,TYRION,"Alright . No drinking . We can play without drinking . It’s a wonderful game . I invented it . Here’s how it works . I make a statement about your past . If I’m wrong, I drink . And if I’m right -- Maybe we can’t play without drinking . VARYS enters the room."
5916,4,2,TYRION,"Oh, you took your time ."
5917,4,2,VARYS,Sorry . I was busy learning who funds the Sons of the Harpy . Some things you can’t rush .
5918,4,2,MISSANDEI,You found out?
5919,4,2,VARYS,The good masters of Astapor . And the wise masters of Yunkai . With help from their friends in Volantis .
5920,4,2,TYRION,You see? You don’t even have to worry about the local rebellion . We only have to worry about the three rich foreign cities paying for it .
5921,4,2,WORM,We conquered Asatapor and Yunkai once . We will do it again and execute the Masters .
5922,4,2,TYRION,"If the Unsullied march off to reconquer Asatapor and Yunkai, who remain to defend the free people of Meereen?"
5923,4,2,WORM,"If we do not fight them, how can we stop them?"
5924,4,2,MISSANDEI,"We cannot . The Masters only speak one language . They spoke it to me for many years . I know it better than my mother tongue . If we want them to hear us, we must speak it back to them . May it be the last thing they ever hear . TYRION nods."
5925,4,2,TYRION,You may be right .
5926,4,2,WORM,So we will fight them?
5927,4,2,TYRION,Possibly .
5928,4,2,MISSANDEI,Possibly?
5929,4,2,TYRION,It’s a conversation . TYRION turns to VARYS.
5930,4,2,TYRION,"Tell me, can the little birds get a message to the good Masters of Astapor, the wise Masters of Yunkai, the benevolent enslavers of Volantis ?"
5931,4,2,VARYS,"Of course . Man can be fickle, but birds always trust . INT. RED KEEP - VAULTS A group of Varys' child spies are gathered together. One LITTLE BIRD picks up a model of a planet. Another child plays with an hourglass."
5932,4,2,QYBURN,"Your eye looks much better, Arthur . How’s your mother’s jaw?"
5933,4,2,ARTHUR,Better .
5934,4,2,QYBURN,And your father?
5935,4,2,ARTHUR,No one’s seen him .
5936,4,2,QYBURN,And no one will . That worked out rather nicely .
5937,4,2,BIRD,Will Lord Varys ever come back?
5938,4,2,QYBURN,I don’t think so . Do you miss him?
5939,4,2,BIRD,He was nice .
5940,4,2,ARTHUR,He called us his little birds . He gave us sweets . QYBURN stands up and walks to a table.
5941,4,2,QYBURN,It’s funny you should mention that . Guess what I happened to find today . Candied plums from Dorne . He nods at the boxes. Eeach child picks one. They nibble at the plums.
5942,4,2,QYBURN,"Now remember, if any of your friends like sweets or need help, they can always come to me . All I need in return are whispers . The door opens. GREGOR walks in, followed by JAIME and CERSEI."
5943,4,2,QYBURN,"No need to be afraid . This is Ser Gregor . He’s friends with all my friends . GREGOR looks at the children. They stare at him, motionless."
5944,4,2,QYBURN,Run along now . The children run up the stairs.
5945,4,2,CERSEI,Varys's little birds ?
5946,4,2,QYBURN,"Your little birds now, your Grace . JAIME is admiring GREGOR."
5947,4,2,JAIME,What did you do to him exactly ? I haven't been able to get a clear answer .
5948,4,2,QYBURN,"Oh, a number of things ."
5949,4,2,JAIME,"Does he understand what we’re saying ? I mean, to the extent that he ever understood complete sentences in the first place . GREGOR turns his head to JAIME. JAIME recoils."
5950,4,2,QYBURNS,He understands well enough .
5951,4,2,JAIME,So tell him to march into the sept and crush the High Sparrow’s head like a melon .
5952,4,2,CERSEI,The High Sparrow has hundreds of Faith Militant surrounding him . Ser Gregor will can’t face them all . And he won’t have to . He’ll only have to face one .
5953,4,2,JAIME,Has the Faith leveled official charges yet?
5954,4,2,CERSEI,Not yet .
5955,4,2,JAIME,"That is one trial by combat I look forward to watching . CERSEI (to QYBURN): Don’t stop at the city . I want little birds in Dorne, in Highgarden, in the North . If someone is planning on making our losses their gains I want to hear it . If someone is laughing at the queen who walk naked through the streets covered in shit, I want to hear . I want to know who they are . I want to where they are . QYBURN bows his head to CERSEI."
5956,4,2,TO,"RED KEEP - SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER KEVAN LANNISTER chairs a meeting of the Small Council. MAESTER PYCELLE, MACE TYRELL and LADY OLENNA have all gathered around him."
5957,4,2,PYCELLE,"As bad as Lord Varys was Varys was, Qyburn is worse . I told them all . I told them . He’s arrogant, dangerous . You don’t get thrown out of the Citadel without good reason . And no one listened to my advice, so here we are . JAIME, CERSEI and SER GREGOR enter the room."
5958,4,2,PYCELLE,"And what he's done to Gregor Clegane is an abomination . We never sanctioned this, this experiment . And I for one think it would be in our best interest to have the beast dest -- MAESTER PYCELLE notices the new guests. He farts."
5959,4,2,KEVAN,Can I help you ? CERSEI (to LADY OLENNA): Why are you here ?
5960,4,2,TYRELL,My mother...
5961,4,2,OLENNA,"I was invited, my dear, o help deal with several troublesome issues, such as the queen’s imprisonment ."
5962,4,2,CERSEI,Thank you for bringing it up . It’s well past time we addressed the abuses I endured .
5963,4,2,OLENNA,Margaery is the queen . You are not the queen because you’re not married to the king . I do appreciate these things can get a bit confusing in your family . KEVAN (to CERSEI & company): This is a Small Council meeting . You have no position on the Small Council .
5964,4,2,JAIME,I’m Lord Commander of the Kingsguard . The Lord Commander of the Kingsguard does have a position on the Small Council .
5965,4,2,CERSEI,"Grand Maester Pycelle, would you sanction that statement?"
5966,4,2,PYCELLE,"Well, um...I would say Ser Gerold Hightower had a seat on the Mad King’s council . Of course, that was the Mad King . King Robert saw things differently . JAIME pushes two chairs to the table. JAIME and CERSEI sit down. MAESTER PYCELLE keeps his mouth. The members of the Council look at JAIME and CERSEI. CERSEI (to KEVAN): What about Myrcella’s death, Uncle? Do you consider the murder of your own blood a troublesome issue?"
5967,4,2,JAIME,The same women who murdered Myrcella have overthrown House Martell and taken control of Dorne . We've got a lot to discuss . All of us together .
5968,4,2,CERSEI,"And seeing as you cannot make us leave, we best get on with it ."
5969,4,2,KEVAN,"No, we cannot make you leave . And you cannot make us stay . Not unless you're gonna have that thing murder us all . One by one, KEVAN LANNISTER, LADY OLENNA and MACE TYRELL leave the room. MAESTER PYCELLE picks up his paperwork and shuffles slowly. He then runs out of the door when SER GREGOR looks at him threateningly. JAIME, CERSEI and SER GREGOR are left alone in the room."
5970,4,2,TO,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM The HIGH SPARROW is praying. TOMMEN enters the room with his guards. The HIGH SPARROW stands up.
5971,4,2,SPARROW,"Oh, your Grace ."
5972,4,2,TOMMEN,My mother would like to see her daughter’s final resting place .
5973,4,2,SPARROW,"Oh, I'm, sorry, your Grace . That’s not possible . Not yet ."
5974,4,2,TOMMEN,When will it be possible?
5975,4,2,SPARROW,When she's fully atoned for her sins .
5976,4,2,TOMMEN,You’ve cut off her hair and marched her naked through the streets in front of the whole city . That wasn’t a full atonement?
5977,4,2,SPARROW,"No . She must stand trial before seven septons, so we can learn the true extant of her sins ."
5978,4,2,TOMMEN,I want you to let her see Myrcella’s resting place . Several Faith Militant gather behind the HIGH SPARROW.
5979,4,2,TOMMEN,I am the king .
5980,4,2,SPARROW,You are .
5981,4,2,TOMMEN,And what does that mean to you ?
5982,4,2,SPARROW,It means a great deal to me . The crown and the faith are the twin pillars of the world . Do you know who told me that ? Your mother . TOMMEN walks closer to the HIGH SPARROW. He guards tense.
5983,4,2,TOMMEN,My mother who is unclean? My mother who still needs to atone after all you’ve put her through? The HIGH SPARROW signs that his guards need to leave. They leave. TOMMEN puts his hand in the air and points to his guards. They leave. HIGH SPARROW closes the book lying on the table behind him.
5984,4,2,SPARROW,"How do you think the Mother Above first came to us? How did men and women first come to feel the Mother’s presence? It was through their own mothers . There is a great deal of falsehood in Cersei, you know that . But when she speaks of you, the Mother’s love outshines it all . Her love for you is more real than anything else in this world . Because it doesn’t come from this world . But you know that . You’ve felt it . You’ve seen her when she talks to you ."
5985,4,2,TOMMEN,Yes .
5986,4,2,SPARROW,It’s a great gift . One I never had . Envy . One more thing for me to atone for . HIGH SPARROW points to a bench in the room.
5987,4,2,SPARROW,"You Grace, may I? Do you mind? It's my knees ."
5988,4,2,TOMMEN,Of course . HIGH SPARROW sighs and sits down.
5989,4,2,SPARROW,"When your mother made her walk of atonement, she did it to get back to you ."
5990,4,2,TOMMEN,I still don’t understand why you want to put her through any more than she's already endured .
5991,4,2,SPARROW,It’s not what I want . It’s what the gods want . They make their will known to us and it’s up to us to either accept or reject it . The HIGH SPARROW palms the seat next to him.
5992,4,2,SPARROW,Please . TOMMEN sits down next to him.
5993,4,2,SPARROW,"If we’re to be just and good, then we accept it, all of us, even kings . A true leader avails himself of the wisest council he can . And no one is wiser than the gods ."
5994,4,2,TOMMEN,My grandfather once said something similar . Except for the part about the gods .
5995,4,2,SPARROW,"The gods worked through him whether he knew it or not . As they work through your mother . There’s so much good in all of us . The best we can do is to help each other bring it out . INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE The WAIF and ARYA are standing on a raised platform. The WAIF scrapes her staff on the floor around ARYA, then pushes the end of it against ARYA's head. ARYA turns around. The WAIF nudges her and she flinches. Cut to the WAIF and ARYA sitting on the ground across from each other."
5996,4,2,WAIF,Who are you ?
5997,4,2,ARYA,No one . The WAIF hits ARYA with a stick. ARYA falls on the ground but gets up.
5998,4,2,WAIF,Who were you before you came here ?
5999,4,2,ARYA,Arya Stark . Cut to ARYA and the WAIF on the combat platform.  ARYA tries to fight but the WAIF beats her. ARYA falls to the ground. Her mouth's bleeding. Cut back to the WAIF and ARYA sitting across from each other.
6000,4,2,WAIF,Tell me about Arya Stark’s family .
6001,4,2,ARYA,"Her father was Eddard Stark . Her mother was Catelyn Stark . She had one sister, Sansa, and four brothers . The WAIF corrects her with a whip of the stick. Cut to the fighting platform. The WAIF kicks ARYA's staff back into her grasp. Cut back to the pair sitting across from each other."
6002,4,2,ARYA,"Three brothers . Cut back to the fighting platform. As ARYA speaks each of her brothers' names, the WAIF strikes her. ARYA (V.O.): Rob, Bran, Rickon . And a half-brother, Jon ."
6003,4,2,WAIF,"And where are they now? Cut to ARYA standing in front of a small table. Several bowls are filled with powder. A glass bottle stands behind each bowel. ARYA (V.O.): They may be dead for all a girl knows . ARYA sniffs one of the bowls of powder, then recoils. She sniffs another bowl and wafts the scent with her hand. Cut back to the pair sitting across from each other."
6004,4,2,WAIF,"Tell me about The Hound . Cut back to the fighting platform. ARYA (V.O.): Also dead . ARYA deflects several of the WAIF's blows, but is pushed to the edge of the platform and falls when the WAIF smacks her across the face with her staff."
6005,4,2,ARYA,Arya Stark left him to die . He was on her list . Cut to the pair sitting across from each other. The WAIF smacks ARYA with the stick.
6006,4,2,ARYA,He was not on her list anymore . She’d taken him off it .
6007,4,2,WAIF,Why? Didn’t she want him dead any longer ? Cut back to the power table.
6008,4,2,ARYA,"She did and she did not . ARYA lifts a spoon of the powder to the jar behind it. The Faceless Man, taking on the form of JAQEN H'GHAR, looks on. Cut back to the pair sitting across from each other."
6009,4,2,WAIF,She sounds confused .
6010,4,2,ARYA,"Yes, she was . Cut back to the powder table. ARYA dumps the spoonful of powder in the bottle. Cut back to the pair sitting across from each other."
6011,4,2,WAIF,"Who else was on Arya Stark’s funny little list? Cut back to the fighting platform. The WAIF beats down ARYA repeatedly until ARYA can no longer get up. ARYA (V.O.): Cersei Lannister, Gregor Clegane, Walder Frey . The WAIF walks away from ARYA, but stops when ARYA begins to stand up. The WAIF turns back to face ARYA."
6012,4,2,WAIF,That’s a short list . That can’t be everyone you want to kill . ARYA stands up and holds her staff out at the WAIF. Cut back to the pair sitting across from each other.
6013,4,2,WAIF,Are you sure you’re not forgetting someone ?
6014,4,2,ARYA,"Which name would you like a girl to speak? Cut back to the fighting platform. ARYA and the WAIF exchange blows, but ARYA knocks back the WAIF. JAQN H'GHAR looks on.The WAIF returns with a heavy blow, but ARYA blocks it. The WAIF walks away. ARYA turns to face JAQEN H'GHAR."
6015,4,2,TO,HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE - MAIN CHAMBER ARYA is sitting in front of a fireplace. JAQEN is standing in front of the well in the center of the room.
6016,4,2,JAQEN,"If a girl tells me her name, I will give her eyes back ."
6017,4,2,ARYA,A girl has no name .
6018,4,2,JAQEN,Come . ARYA walks to the well. JAQEN gives ARYA a bowl of water. ARYA hesitates to drink it.

6020,4,2,JAQEN,Who are you?
6021,4,2,ARYA,No one . EXT. NORTHERN WILDERNESS A horse and carriage are toting a few members of House Umber towards Winterfell.
6022,4,2,TO,WINTERFELL - DINING HALL RAMSAY and LORD KARSTARK are seated at the dining table. A lady serves them drinks. SMALLJON is standing in front of them.
6023,4,2,RAMSAY,The Umbers are a famously loyal house .
6024,4,2,KARSTARK,Famously loyal to the Starks .
6025,4,2,SMALLJON,"And you, Lord Karstark ? Your people share blood with the Starks, don’t they?  But here we are . Times change ."
6026,4,2,RAMSAY,"When my father became Warden of the North, your house refused to pledge their banners ."
6027,4,2,SMALLJON,Your father was a cunt .
6028,4,2,RAMSAY,"My beloved father, the Warden --"
6029,4,2,SMALLJON,"Your father was a cunt and that’s why you killed him . I might’ve done the same to my father, if he hadn’t have done me the favor of dying on his own ."
6030,4,2,RAMSAY,My father was poisoned by our enemies .
6031,4,2,SMALLJON,Mmm .
6032,4,2,RAMSAY,"Why have you come to Winterfell, Lord Umber?"
6033,4,2,SMALLJON,"The bastard Jon Snow led an army of wildlings past the Wall . We’re farther north than any of you fuckers . Wildlings come down, we always have to fight them first . I like fighting wildlings, been doing it all my life . But there are too many of them for us to beat back alone ."
6034,4,2,RAMSAY,So now you’ve come seeking help?
6035,4,2,SMALLJON,"We need to help each other . The colder it gets, the farther South those goat fuckers will roam . Won't take them long to get here ."
6036,4,2,KARSTARK,You think a horde of wildlings can take Winterfell ?
6037,4,2,SMALLJON,"If they get Jon Snow leading them, maybe . He knows this place better than we ever will ."
6038,4,2,RAMSAY,Pledge your banners to House Bolton . Swear loyalty to me as Warden of the North and we will fight together to destroy the bastard and all his wildling friends .
6039,4,2,SMALLJON,I’m not kissing your fucking hand .
6040,4,2,RAMSAY,Traditionally a bannerman kneels before his lord .
6041,4,2,SMALLJON,I’m not doing that either .
6042,4,2,RAMSAY,Why would I trust a man who won’t honor tradition?
6043,4,2,SMALLJON,Your father honored tradition . Knelt for Robb Stark . Called him King of the North . Was Robb Stark right to trust your father?
6044,4,2,RAMSAY,Then it appears we're at a bit of an impasse .
6045,4,2,SMALLJON,Fuck kneeling and fuck oaths . I've got a gift for you .
6046,4,2,RAMSAY,"A girl, I hope . I prefer redheads . Two hooded people are dragged into the hall."
6047,4,2,SMALLJON,"A girl, aye . A wild one . SMALLJON pulls the hood off one of the people, revealing OSHA. RAMSAY stands up."
6048,4,2,RAMSAY,I like them wild .
6049,4,2,SMALLJON,"And the boy, nice and young . The way Karstark likes them . LORD KARSTARK stands up. SMALLJON pulls the hood off the other person, revealing RICKON STARK."
6050,4,2,RAMSAY,Who’s this?
6051,4,2,SMALLJON,Rickon Stark .
6052,4,2,RAMSAY,"How do I know that’s Rickon Stark? SMALLJOY retrieves the severed head of Rickon's direwolf SHAGGYDOG and places it on the table. RAMSAY examines the head, looks at SMALLJON, and then smiles at RICKON."
6053,4,2,RAMSAY,"Welcome home, Lord Stark . INT. CASTLE BLACK – JON SNOW’S CHAMBER JON SNOW is sitting by the fireplace. He is looking to the ground. Someone knocks on the door. DOLOROUS EDD walks in."
6054,4,2,EDD,"It’s time . JON SNOW gets up, drops his vest with the stab holes in it on the table, and grabs his sword Longclaw."
6055,4,2,TO,"CASTLE BLACK – COURTYARD MELISANDRE is standing on a balcony overlooking the courtyard. TORMUND, DAVOS, the wildlings, and the Night's Watch are all in attendance. JON SNOW walks past them, going up the stairs towards the gallows. DOLOROUS EDD accompanies him. BOWEN MARSH, OTHELL YARWICK, ALLISER THORNE, and OLLY are standing on a platform with their hands tied and ropes around their necks. JON SNOW looks up at them."
6056,4,2,SNOW,"If you have any last words, now is the time ."
6057,4,2,MARSH,You shouldn’t be alive . It’s not right .
6058,4,2,SNOW,Neither was killing me .
6059,4,2,YARWICK,My mother's still living at White Harbor . Could you write her? Tell her I died fighting the wildings .
6060,4,2,THRONE,"I had a choice, Lord Commander . Betray you or betray the Night’s Watch . You brought an army of wildlings into our lands . An army of muderers and raiders . If I had to do it all over knowing where I’d end up, I pray I’d make the right choice again ."
6061,4,2,SNOW,"I’m sure you would, Ser Alliser ."
6062,4,2,THRONE,"I fought, I lost . Now I rest . But you, Lord Snow, you’ll be fighting their battles forever . JON SNOW looks at OLLY. OLLY stares back at him, unwavering. JON SNOW turns his back and unsheathes Longclaw. He breathes heavily. JON SNOW cuts the rope. The platform is pulled out from under the traitors’ feet. They are hung. They choke and die. JON SNOW looks at OLLY again. OLLY's face is blue and swollen. JON SNOW sheathes his sword, then walks up to DOLOROUS EDD."
6063,4,2,EDD,We should burn the bodies .
6064,4,2,SNOW,You should . JON SNOW takes off his cape and hands it to DOLOROUS EDD.
6065,4,2,EDD,What do you want me to do with this?
6066,4,2,SNOW,Wear it . Burn it . Whatever you want . You have Castle Black . JON SNOW walks down the stairs.
6067,4,3,DEFAULT,"Book of the Stranger (Script) Lyrics TITLE SEQUENCE INT. CASTLE BLACK - JON SNOW’S ROOM Longclaw is lying on a table. DOLOROUS EDD lifts and admires it, then turns to JON SNOW who is putting some items in a bag."

6069,4,3,SNOW,South .
6070,4,3,EDD,What are you gonna do?
6071,4,3,SNOW,Get warm . JON SNOW smiles. DOLOROUS EDD places Longclaw on the table.
6072,4,3,EDD,I was with you at Hardhome . We saw what’s out there . We know it’s coming here . How can you leave us now?
6073,4,3,SNOW,I did everything I could . You know that .

6077,4,3,SNOW,"They killed me, Edd! My own brothers . You want me to stay here after that? A single horn sounds outside. JON SNOW and DOLOROUS EDD look to the doorway. MAN (O.S.): Riders approaching! MAN #2 (O.S.): Open the gate!"
6078,4,3,TO,"CASTLE BLACK - COURTYARD The southern gates open. SANSA, BRIENNE, and PODRICK enter the courtyard on horseback. The Night’s Watch and the Wildlings all watfch them. TORMUND stares intently at BRIENNE. The trio dismount from their horses. JON SNOW and DOLOROUS EDD emerge onto a balcony overlooking the courtyard. SANSA slowly spins around until she and JON SNOW lock eyes. JON SNOW descends from the balcony and walks to SANSA. They stare at each other and then embrace."
6079,4,3,TO,CASTLE BLACK - JON SNOW’S ROOM JON SNOW and SANSA are sitting by the fire. SANSA lifts a bowl to her lips and drinks from it.
6080,4,3,SANSA,This is good soup . Do you remember those kidney pies Old Nan used to make?
6081,4,3,SNOW,With the peas and onions?
6082,4,3,SANSA,Mmm .
6083,4,3,SNOW,We never should have left Winterfell .
6084,4,3,SANSA,"Don’t you wish we could go back to the day we left? I want to scream at myself, “Don’t go, you idiot . ”"
6085,4,3,SNOW,How could we know?
6086,4,3,SANSA,I spent a lot of time thinking about what as ass I was to you . I wish I could change everything .
6087,4,3,SNOW,We were children .
6088,4,3,SANSA,"I was awful, just admit it . JON SNOW chuckles."
6089,4,3,SNOW,You were occasionally awful . I’m sure I can’t have been great fun . Always sulking in the corner while the rest of you played .
6090,4,3,SANSA,Can you forgive me?
6091,4,3,SNOW,There’s nothing to forgive .
6092,4,3,SANSA,Forgive me .
6093,4,3,SNOW,"All right . All right, I forgive you . SANSA laughs, then holds out her hand for JON SNOW’s horn of ale. JON SNOW gives it to her. She sips, then coughs. JON SNOW laughs."
6094,4,3,SNOW,"You’d think after thousands of years, the Night’s Watch would have learned how to make a good ale ."
6095,4,3,SANSA,Where will you go?
6096,4,3,SNOW,"Where will we go? If I don’t watch over you, Father’s ghost will come back and murder me ."
6097,4,3,SANSA,Where will we go?

6099,4,3,SANSA,There’s only one place we can go . Home .
6100,4,3,SNOW,Should we tell the Boltons to pack up and leave?
6101,4,3,SANSA,We’ll take it back from them .
6102,4,3,SNOW,I don’t have an army .
6103,4,3,SANSA,How many wildlings did you save?
6104,4,3,SNOW,They didn’t come here to serve me .
6105,4,3,SANSA,They owe you their lives . SANSA stands and walks to a table. She places her bowl down on it.
6106,4,3,SANSA,You think they’ll be safe here if Roose Bolton remains Warden of the North?
6107,4,3,SNOW,Sansa .
6108,4,3,SANSA,"Winterfell is our home . It’s ours and Arya’s and Bran’s and Rickon’s . Wherever they are, it belongs to our family . We have to fight for it ."
6109,4,3,SNOW,I’m tired of fighting . JON SNOW stands and turns to face SANSA.
6110,4,3,SNOW,It’s all I’ve done since I left home . I’ve killed brothers of the Night’s Watch . I’ve killed wildlings . I’ve killed men that I admire . I hanged a boy younger than Bran . I fought and I lost .

6112,4,3,TO,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY MELISANDRE is looking out over the edge of the balcony. DAVOS approaches her.

6116,4,3,MELISANDRE,I will do as Jon Snow commands .
6117,4,3,DAVOS,You serve Jon Snow now?
6118,4,3,MELISANDRE,He’s the prince that was promised .
6119,4,3,DAVOS,"Forgive me, my lady, I thought that was Stannis . MELISANDRE walks away from DAVOS and down into the courtyard. DAVOS follows her."
6120,4,3,DAVOS,What happened down there?
6121,4,3,MELISANDRE,"There was a battle . Stannis was defeated . MELISANDRE continues to walk away, but DAVOS grabs her arm to stop her."
6122,4,3,DAVOS,And Shireen? What happened to the princess? BRIENNE approaches.
6123,4,3,BRIENNE,I saw what happened . I saw Stannis’ forces defeated in the field .
6124,4,3,DAVOS,"My lady, I’m Ser Davos Seaworth ."
6125,4,3,BRIENNE,We’ve met before . I was Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon . Before Renly was assassinated with bloodmagic . BRIENNE stares at MELISANDRE.

6127,4,3,BRIENNE,"Yes, it’s in the past . It doesn’t mean I forget . Or forgive . He admitted it, you know ."

EYRIE TRAINING GROUNDS - DAY ROBIN is aiming at a target with a bow and arrow. He shoots, but the arrow falls short. YOHN ROYCE sighs to himself. ROBIN looks to YOHN ROYCE for approval. YOHN ROYCE smiles. A carriage approaches, accompanied by several knights. The knight driving the carriages dismouts and extends the carriage steps. LITTLEFINGER emerges from the carriage. LITTLEFINGER (to ROBIN): The Defender of the Vale!"
6130,4,3,ROBIN,Uncle Petyr! ROBIN drops the bow and arrow and runs to LITTLEFINGER. They embrace.
6131,4,3,LITTLEFINGER,My lord . Come and see . LITTLEFINGER ushers ROBIN to the rear of the carriage.
6132,4,3,LITTLEFINGER,"I missed your name day . Go on . ROBIN and LITTLEFINGER pull a sheet from the back of the carriage, revealing a cage with a falcon inside. The falcon squawks. ROBIN gasps."
6133,4,3,ROBIN,A falcon!
6134,4,3,LITTLEFINGER,A gyrfalcon . The greatest and rarest of birds .
6135,4,3,ROYCE,"Last time I saw you, Baelish, you told me you were taking Sansa Stark home with you to the Fingers."
6136,4,3,LITTLEFINGER,Indeed I was .
6137,4,3,ROYCE,"And yet not long ago, we received reports that she has been married to Ramsay Bolton in Winterfell ."
6138,4,3,LITTLEFINGER,"On our way to the Fingers, we were set upon by a large force of Bolton men . Seemed to know exactly when we were traveling and exactly whom we were transporting ."
6139,4,3,ROYCE,Do you take me for a fool?
6140,4,3,LITTLEFINGER,"Tell me, Lord Royce, how many people knew of my travel plans with Sansa Stark? I shared my intentions with you and no one else . The ensuing conversation momentarily distracts ROBIN from admiring the falcon. YOHN ROYCE approaches LITTLEFINGER slowly."
6141,4,3,ROYCE,"Slander a man in his own home, you might find yourself crossing swords with him ."
6142,4,3,LITTLEFINGER,Your home is the Vale . The Lord of the Vale stands before us . And only his judgment concerns me . YOHN ROYCE looks to ROBIN.
6143,4,3,ROBIN,Shall we throw him through the Moon Door? The surrounding knights begin to approach YOHN ROYCE. YOHN ROYCE walks closer to ROBIN.
6144,4,3,ROYCE,"My lord . My lord, I have always been faithful to House Arryn . To your father, to your mother, and now to you."
6145,4,3,ROBIN,"Do you believe him, Uncle Petyr? YOHN ROYCE turns back to look at LITTLEFINGER."
6146,4,3,LITTLEFINGER,"Lord Royce has served the Vale well . He;s enjoyed a distinguished military career . If we could trust his absolute loyalty, he would make a capable commander in the wars to come . YOHN ROYCE turns back to ROBIN."
6147,4,3,ROYCE,"You can trust my absolute loyalty, my lord ."
6148,4,3,LITTLEFINGER,I think he deserves one more chance . What do you say?
6149,4,3,ROBIN,"Fine . YOHN ROYCE bows and walks a few feet away from the engagement. LITTLEFINGER (to ROBIN): I bring good news . My friends in the North tell me Sansa has escaped Winterfell . I expect she’s headed to Castle Black where her brother serves as Lord Commander . But she won’t be safe there, not with the Boltons after her ."
6150,4,3,ROBIN,She’s my cousin . We should help her .
6151,4,3,LITTLEFINGER,That was my instinct as well . LITTLEFINGER turns and walks towards YOHN ROYCE.
6152,4,3,LITTLEFINGER,"Our lord has spoken . Gather the Knights of the Vale . The time has come to join the fray . EXT. MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE - DAY A ship is entering the harbor. TYRION, VARYS, MISSANDEI, and GREY WORM are standing on the shore watching its approach."
6153,4,3,WORM,You invite the enemy into our city?
6154,4,3,TYRION,"I did . As a clever man once told me, “We make peace with our enemies, not our friends . ” TYRION begins walking away. The others follow."
6155,4,3,WORM,I don’t make peace with the queen’s enemies . I kill the queen’s enemies .
6156,4,3,TYRION,"Yes, that’s the military approach . And how has that worked here in Meereen? I represent the diplomatic approach . TYRION and VARYS begin ascending the stairs to the Great Pyramid."
6157,4,3,MISSANDEI,Our queen tried to make peace with the Masters and they tried to murder her . TYRION and VARYS turn back to face MISSANDEI and GREY WORM. TYRION We enter these negotiations with open eyes . Trust me . My own recent experience with slavery has taught me the horrors of that institution .
6158,4,3,MISSANDEI,How many days were you a slave? TYRION stammers.
6159,4,3,TYRION,Long enough to know .
6160,4,3,MISSANDEI,Not long enough to understand . TYRION and VARYS proceed up the steps. MISSANDEI and GREY WORM follow.
6161,4,3,TO,"MEEREEN - COUNCIL CHAMBER TYRION, VARYS, MISSANDEI, and GREY WORM are sitting in attendance to three masters, YEZZAN ZO QAGGAZ, RAZDAL MO ERAZ, and BELICHO PAENYMION."
6162,4,3,YEZZAN,I bought this dwarf for a single gold honor . And somehow you’ve risen to the top of the Great Pyramid of Meereen . It’s most impressive .
6163,4,3,TYRION,And now you speak for the Good Masters of Astapor . Here’s to reversals of fortune .
6164,4,3,RAZDAL,We came here to meet the queen and instead we’re greeted by a dwarf and a eunuch .
6165,4,3,TYRION,"Let’s make this simple, shall we? Tell me what you want ."
6166,4,3,BELICHO,We want you to leave Slaver’s Bay . Take your dragons and your mercenaries and go .
6167,4,3,TYRION,Queen Daenerys won’t stay in Meereen forever . Her path takes her westward .
6168,4,3,RAZDAL,"When we last met, I offered her ships so she could return to Westeros where she belongs . She refused them ."
6169,4,3,MISSANDEI,"She refused them because hundreds of thousands of men, women, and children still lived in chains ."
6170,4,3,RAZDAL,As they have since the dawn of time .
6171,4,3,WORM,Not anymore .
6172,4,3,YEZZAN,You think you’re a free man now? You still follow orders . Just because your master has silver hair and tits doesn’t mean she’s not a master .
6173,4,3,TYRION,"Friends, friends, friends, please . GREY WORM stares intently at YEZZAN."
6174,4,3,TYRION,There have always been those with wealth and power and those with nothing . That is the way of the world . I’m not here to change the way of the world .
6175,4,3,YEZZAN,Slavery is the way of our world .
6176,4,3,TYRION,You don’t need slaves to make money . There haven’t been slaves in Westeros for hundreds of years and I grew up richer than any of you . But our queen recognizes that she erred by abolishing slavery without providing a new system to replace it . So here is the queen’s proposal . Slavery will never return to Meereen but she will give the other cities of Slaver’s Bay time to adjust to the new order .
6177,4,3,YEZZAN,What does that mean?
6178,4,3,TYRION,"Instead of abolishing slavery overnight, we will give you seven years to end the practice . The masters look at each others."
6179,4,3,TYRION,"Slaveholders will be compensated for their losses, of course, at fair prices . In exchange, you will cut off your support for the Sons of the Harpy ."
6180,4,3,YEZZAN,We do not support the Sons of the Harpy .
6181,4,3,TYRION,"Fine, fine, but you will cut it off all the same . I do hope you accept, my friends . You will not receive a better offer . TYRION picks up a bell from the table beside him and rings it."
6182,4,3,TYRION,Let us sail on the tide of freedom instead of being drowned by it . And as a parting gift to our honored guests… Three women enter. Each one sits in the lap of one of the masters.
6183,4,3,TYRION,"Give freedom a chance . See if it doesn’t taste every bit as good as what came before . TYRION exits. VARYS, MISSANDEI, and GREY WORM follow."

6185,4,3,TYRION,Excellent . MAN #2: You met with the slavers today .
6186,4,3,TYRION,I did . MAN #1: Our brothers and sister died fighting these scum . Now you invite them to our city and drink wine with them .
6187,4,3,TYRION,I imagine this room was built so the rulers could intimidate the ruled . TYRION begins to descend the steps towards the men. MISSANDEI and GREY WORM follow.
6188,4,3,TYRION,But I am not your ruler . I’m not the Breaker of Chains . I’m not the Unburnt . And I am certainly not the Mother of Dragons . TYRION and company reach the bottom of the steps so they are face to face with the men. MAN #1: You are a stranger here . So why do you represent Meereen in these talks with our enemies?
6189,4,3,TYRION,Because our queen chose me as her advisor . Until she returns from her travels -- MAN #2: When does she return?
6190,4,3,TYRION,Soon . You have my word . MAN #1: We don’t know you . We don’t trust you . We know Torgo Nudho . We fight with him against the Masters . We trust him .
6191,4,3,TYRION,"And that is exactly why Grey Worm took part in these negotiations . As commander of the Unsullied, he knows hot to defeat the slavers and he knows when it is time to make peace . MAN #2: You have made peace with the slavers?"
6192,4,3,TYRION,"We offered terms . MAN #1 (speaking Valyrian): And you, Grey Worm? You want to drink wine with these men? The men who tore us from our mothers’ arms and sold us at auction like cattle? GREY WORM (speaking Valyrian): I am a soldier, not a politician . But if there is a chance for peace -- a just peace -- we should take it . MAN #2 (speaking Valyrian): Missandei, you know what these men are . How can you trust them? MISSANDEI (speaking Valyrian): I do not trust them . I will never trust them . MISSANDEI pauses and looks at TYRION. MISSANDEI (speaking Valyrian): But as a wise man once said, “We make peace with our enemies, not our friends . ” TYRION smiles."

6199,4,3,TYRION,I am not betraying her work . I am trying to save her city .
6200,4,3,MISSANDEI,You promised the slavers they could keep slavery .
6201,4,3,TYRION,For a short time .
6202,4,3,MISSANDEI,Seven years is not a short time for a slave .
6203,4,3,TYRION,You’re right . Slavery is a horror that should be ended at once . War is a horror that should be ended at once . I can’t do both today .
6204,4,3,WORM,You are wrong to trust these men .
6205,4,3,TYRION,I don’t trust the Masters . I trust their self-interest . They’re trustworthy if they’re convinced that working with me is in their self-interest .
6206,4,3,WORM,You don’t know them . You don’t understand them . We are not human in their eyes . They look at me and see a weapon . They look at her and see a whore .
6207,4,3,TYRION,They look at me and they see a misshapen little beast . Their contempt is their weakness . They’ll underestimate us every time and we will use that to our advantage .
6208,4,3,WORM,You will not use them . They will use you . That is what they do . EXT. ESSOS MOUNTAIN RANGE - DAY JORAH and DAARIO are walking to the top of a mountain crag. JORAH lags behind and stops to catch his breath. DAARIO turns back to him.
6209,4,3,DAARIO,You all right? Why don’t you sit and catch your breath?
6210,4,3,JORAH,I’m fine . DAARIO chuckles.
6211,4,3,DAARIO,"I don’t think you could ride the dragon . 20 years ago, maybe ."
6212,4,3,JORAH,What?
6213,4,3,DAARIO,"Our queen . She’s wild, you know . Don’t let her size fool you . It’s hard enough for me and I’m a young man . You, I don’t think your heart could take it . JORAH stares at DAARIO for a few moments and then continues along the path."
6214,4,3,DAARIO,Must make you angry that our queen chose me .
6215,4,3,JORAH,Makes me sad . You’ll disappoint her before long . She’ll move on .
6216,4,3,DAARIO,We’ll all disappoint her before long . JORAH turns back to face DAARIO.
6217,4,3,JORAH,We need each other right now . After we’re done needing each other --
6218,4,3,DAARIO,"Oh, I don’t want to fight you, Jorah the Andal . What do I have to gain? If I win, I’m the shit who killed an old man . If I lose, I’m the shit who was killed by an old man ."
6219,4,3,JORAH,"You didn’t get much discipline as a child, did you?"
6220,4,3,DAARIO,None . JORAH and DAARIO crawl to the edge of the ridge and look below. Vaes Dothrak sprawls across the valley floor.
6221,4,3,JORAH,"The road running through the Horse Gate, they call that the godsway . JORAH points to the eastern division of Vaes Dothrak, and then to the western division."
6222,4,3,JORAH,"Eastern Market, Western Market . When Khal Drogo died, she was supposed to come here and join the Dosh Khaleen, the widows of the dead khals . That’s where they would have taken her, the Temple of the Dosh Khaleen . JORAH stands and walks off to the side. He begins undoing his sword belt."
6223,4,3,DAARIO,What are you doing?
6224,4,3,JORAH,It’s forbidden to carry weapons in the sacred city .
6225,4,3,DAARIO,Isn’t it forbidden to sneak into their city and steal their khaleesi?
6226,4,3,JORAH,"If they spot us and we’re unarmed, we’ll say we’re traders heading for the Western Market . But if they see weapons…"
6227,4,3,DAARIO,You’re asking a dog to hand over his teeth .
6228,4,3,JORAH,"There’s 100,000 of them down there . We can’t fight our way out . We wait till dark, and then we’ll find her . DAARIO hands over his weapons, except for his dagger. JORAH holds his hand out for the dagger."
6229,4,3,DARRIO,Uh… DAARIO flips the knife around in his hand.
6230,4,3,DAARIO,"I’m very attached to this knife . DAARIO kisses and strokes the knife, then motions to hand it to JORAH. He spots the patch of greyscale on JORAH’s arm through a hole in his sleeve. JORAH pinches the fabric of his sleeve together to cover up the greyscale."
6231,4,3,JORAH,Don’t worry . it didn’t touch you .
6232,4,3,DAARIO,You know what happens?
6233,4,3,JORAH,I know what happens . DAARIO gestures with the dagger.
6234,4,3,DAARIO,I’ll do it myself. JORAH walks to the side and stares into space.
6235,4,3,TO,VAES DOTHRAK - NIGHT Dothraki men and women are celebrating in the streets. JORAH and DAARIO are sneaking through the stables. They crouch down in front of a railing and see a Dothraki man and woman fornicating.
6236,4,3,DAARIO,"I should have been born a Dothraki . JORAH and DAARIO sneak into an alleyway. They move through the alley, but spot two Dothraki men coming their way. JORAH grabs DAARIO."
6237,4,3,JORAH,Come on . JORAN and DAARIO walk out to greet the Dothraki men. They proceed to speak in Dothraki.
6238,4,3,JORAH,My friends...We wandered off from the Western Market and got lost . Could you show us the way back? DOTHRAKI #1: What do you sell?
6239,4,3,JORAH,"Wine . Come down to my stall tomorrow, I’ll give you a cask of the Arbor’s finest . DOTHRAKI #1: You’re not merchants . The Dothraki man inclines his head towards his fellow man. DOTHRAKI #1: Get the others . The second Dothraki man runs down the alleyway. DAARIO darts after him. JORAH swings at the first Dothraki man, but misses. The Dothraki man knees him in the face, knocking him to the ground. DAARIO continues to pursue the other Dothraki man. JORAH strikes his foe twice, but both are blocked. The Dothraki man strikes back with a punch to the face that sends JORAH sprawling. In the alley, just before the other Dothraki man reaches the common area, DAARIO grabs him from behind, places his hand over his mouth, and then snaps his neck. JORAH is rebuffed by his foe a third time. He attempts to throw sand in the Dothraki man’s face, but he dodges out of the way. JORAH climbs to his knees, but the Dothraki man grabs him by the throat and begins choking him. DAARIO stabs the Dothraki man from behind, killing him."
6240,4,3,DAARIO,"Told you, I’m very attached to this knife . DAARIO tucks the dagger away in his shirt. JORAH climbs to his feet."
6241,4,3,DAARIO,You all right?
6242,4,3,JORAH,"If they find a body with a stab wound, the whole city will be looking for us . DAARIO grabs a large rock and smashes the dead Dothraki man with it several times."
6243,4,3,DAARIO,Huh .
6244,4,3,TO,"VAES DOTHRAK - TEMPLE OF THE DOSH KHALEEN DAENERYS is sitting among the Dosh Khaleen. The women whisper among themselves, but the leader sits beside DAENERYS. They begin to speak in Dothraki."
6245,4,3,LEADER,Some of them don’t think Dothraki should breed with foreigners . They are stupid old women . They don’t realize that we have always diluted our blood . This one is Lhazareen . Her Khal found her hiding in a well after he burned her village . How old were you?
6246,4,3,WOMAN,Twelve .
6247,4,3,LEADER,"A year later, she bore her Khal a daughter . How did he show his happiness?"
6248,4,3,WOMAN,He broke my ribs .
6249,4,3,LEADER,"We are not queens here, but the khals depend on us for our wisdom . Our lives have meaning ."
6250,4,3,DAENERYS,That is more than most have .
6251,4,3,LEADER,"When the khals meet for the Khalar Vezhven tomorrow night, I hope they let you live out your days with us . The other possibilities are not so pleasant ."
6252,4,3,DAENERYS,I need to make water .
6253,4,3,LEADER,You can’t run from Dothraki . You know this .
6254,4,3,DAENERYS,"I will never run from Dothraki . LEADER (to LHAZAREEN WOMAN): Go, show her . The Lhazareen woman takes DAENERYS outside the temple. They walk together."
6255,4,3,DAENERYS,I needed fresh air . The old women stink .
6256,4,3,WOMAN,They do stink .
6257,4,3,DAENERYS,You must have been very young when your Khal died .
6258,4,3,WOMAN,Sixteen .
6259,4,3,DAENERYS,Too bad he didn’t die sooner . DAENERYS and the Lhazareen woman smile at each other.
6260,4,3,WOMAN,"Yes, too bad . The pair round a bend to a secluded desert outcropping."
6261,4,3,WOMAN,Is it true you have three dragons?
6262,4,3,DAENERYS,Mm-hmm .
6263,4,3,WOMAN,And they breathe fire?
6264,4,3,DAENERYS,They do . Would you like to see them one day?
6265,4,3,WOMAN,"I am Dosh Khaleen . I can never leave Vaes Dothrak, until I rise as smoke from the pyre on the day I die . DAARIO grabs the Lhazareen woman from behind, covers her mouth, and places his dagger against her neck. JORAH is standing behind DAARIO."
6266,4,3,DAENERYS,"No, don’t hurt her ."
6267,4,3,DAARIO,She’ll give us away .
6268,4,3,JORAH,"We have to go now . DAENERYS grabs DAARIO’s dagger-carrying hand, and he drops it away from the Lhazareen woman’s neck."
6269,4,3,DAENERYS,We will never get out of Vaes Dothrak alive .
6270,4,3,JORAH,All we can do is try .
6271,4,3,DAENERYS,"No . We can do more than that . And you’re going to help me . DAENERYS looks at the Lhazareen woman. DAENERYS (speaking Dothraki): And you...Have faith in me, Khaleesi . Do not betray me . The Lhazareen woman nods. DAENERYS looks at DAARIO. DAARIO slowly removes his hand from her mouth. INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR CELL MARGAERY is sitting in the corner of her cell. SEPTA UNELLA enters, then guides MARGAERY out into the prayer room where the HIGH SPARROW waits. MARGAERY walks into the room and shields her eyes from the sunlight. SEPTA UNELLA pushes MARGAERY to her knees, then exits."
6272,4,3,SPARROW,"If I were to let you leave right now, where would you go? What would you seek out?"
6273,4,3,MARGAERY,"I’d go to my brother, my husband, my family ."
6274,4,3,SPARROW,"Of course, but for you, that means seeking out money, finery, power . Seeking out your family means seeking out sin . I’m not maligning you . I sought those things out, too. To the exclusion of all else . My father was a cobbler . He died with I was young and I took over his shop . He was a simple man and he made simple shoes . But I found that the more work I put into my shoes, the more people wanted them . Fine leather, ornamentation, detailing, and time . Time most of all . Dozens of hours spent on a single pair ."
6275,4,3,MARGAERY,Quality takes time .
6276,4,3,SPARROW,"Yes . I imagine you’ve worn a year of someone’s life on your back . The highborn liked to cover their feet with my time and they paid well for the privilege . I used their money to buy a taste of their lives for myself . Each time I indulged, I felt myself ascending to something better ."
6277,4,3,MARGAERY,"And one day you walked through a graveyard and realized it was all for nothing and set out on the path to righteousness . Book of the Stranger, verse 25 ."
6278,4,3,SPARROW,You know The Seven-Pointed Star.
6279,4,3,MARGAERY,Septa Unella reads it to me . At me .
6280,4,3,SPARROW,"Yes, yes, she does enjoy reading at people . You’re close . But it wasn’t a graveyard . It was a feast . I bought old fine wine and young pretty girls and invited my friends to come share it all . We passed around the wine, passed around the women, and soon we fell into a stupor . I woke before dawn . I could barely stand . Everyone else was asleep on the couches or on the floor, lying in heaps next to their fine clothes . The truth of their bodies laid bare . I could smell them beneath the incense and the perfume and the fine food that had already started to turn . And I saw it with perfect clarity . I saw what my sins were . The gold I had, the wine I drank, the women I used, my ceaseless struggle to maintain my position . It was all part of a story . A story I was telling myself about who I was . A collection of lies that would disappear in the light . The people I was trying to climb away from, the beggars in the street, the poor, they were closer to the truth than I ever was ."
6281,4,3,MARGAERY,So what did you do?
6282,4,3,SPARROW,I left to go and find them . I didn’t even put on my shoes . I walked out the door and never went back . The HIGH SPARROW stands and extends his hand out to MARGAERY.
6283,4,3,SPARROW,"Come, let’s go and see him ."
6284,4,3,MARGAERY,Who?
6285,4,3,SPARROW,Your brother .
6286,4,3,TO,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR – LORAS’ CELL MARGAERY enters her brother’s cell. The door closes and locks behind her. Loras is lying on the floor.
6287,4,3,MARGAERY,Loras. Loras. MARGAERY helps LORAS to his knees. He cries.
6288,4,3,MARGAERY,Listen to me. You need to stay strong.
6289,4,3,LORAS,I can’t stay strong. I never was strong.
6290,4,3,MARGAERY,"You are strong. You are the future of our house, the future of our family."
6291,4,3,LORAS,I don’t care about that.
6292,4,3,MARGAERY,Shh. Have you -- have you told them that? That you don’t care?
6293,4,3,LORAS,I just want it to stop. Help me.
6294,4,3,MARGAERY,"They want me to help you. They want me told help tear you down. That’s why he’s letting me see you, I know it is. And if either of us give in to what they want, then they win."
6295,4,3,LORAS,Let them win. Just make it stop. Please. LORAS begins sobbing. MARGAERY embraces him.
6296,4,3,MARGAERY,All right.
6297,4,3,TO,RED KEEP – TOMMEN'S CHAMBER CERSEI is walking down the hall to TOMMEN’s chamber. She hears MAESTER PYCELLE talking.
6298,4,3,PYCELLE,"And now, how to avert disaster with our current predicament. This High Sparrow. I have dealt with fanatics of every description, Your Grace. Not setting them off, that’s the most important thing. You are beset with enemies both within and without. CERSEI enters the room"
6299,4,3,CERSEI,What are you doing here?
6300,4,3,PYCELLE,I am advising the king on our current predicament. CERSEi: Leave.
6301,4,3,PYCELL,I am a member of the Small Council. The king’s small --
6302,4,3,CERSEI,Is this a Small Council meeting?
6303,4,3,PYCELL,Obviously not. I’m here to lend my wisdom and my support.
6304,4,3,TOMMEN,"Thank you for your counsel, Grand Maester. That will be all for now."
6305,4,3,PYCELL,"Your Grace. MAESTER PYCELLE hobbles towards the door. As he leaves, he flashes CERSEI a smile. CERSEI closes the door."
6306,4,3,CERSEI,"Since I’ve missed the past several Small Coucil meetings, I wanted to speak to you about a few things."
6307,4,3,TOMMEN,I’ve been thinking about the High Sparrow.
6308,4,3,CERSEI,"As have we all, unfortunately."
6309,4,3,TOMMEN,We need to be careful in dealing with such a man. To prevent things from escalating any further. We have to be careful not to antagonize him. He has Margaery. We can’t put her at risk. He’s dangerous. CERSEI takes TOMMEN by the chin.
6310,4,3,CERSEI,Look at me. What did they do to me? To the king’s own mother? TOMMEN looks down.
6311,4,3,CERSEI,It’s all right. It's done. It’s in the past. And of course Margaery’s safety is paramount.
6312,4,3,TOMMEN,"You don’t like Margaery, do you?"
6313,4,3,CERSEI,"Whether I like her or not is completely unimportant. Margaery is the queen. Queens must command respect. Kings even more so. Not just for their own sake, but for everyone’s. The High Sparrow has no respect for kings or queens. No respect for anything in this world. He has no use for the things of this world. He want to knock them down and replace them with what? With fantasies. With beggars in the street. With nothing."
6314,4,3,TOMMEN,Mother...there’s something I want to tell you. Something the High Sparrow told me.
6315,4,3,CERSEI,You’ve spoken with him?
6316,4,3,TOMMEN,I promised him I wouldn’t tell anyone. If he found out I told --
6317,4,3,CERSEI,"It would be a breach of confidence which he would not take lightly, given his constant prattling about the truth. I am your mother. You can always trust me."
6318,4,3,TO,RED KEEP – SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER KEVAN and LADY OLENNA are waiting in the Small Council chamber for the meeting to start. CERSEI and JAIME enter.
6319,4,3,CERSEI,The Small Council meeting has been postponed on the king’s orders. KEVIN and LADY OLENNA stand up.
6320,4,3,OLENNA,I would have thought we were perfectly clear the first time. You’re not welcome.
6321,4,3,CERSEI,You once spoke of your respect for our father because he understood the necessity of working with one’s rivals.
6322,4,3,OLENNA,"My dear, you have been stripped of your dignity and authority, publicly shamed, and confined to the Red Keep. What’s left to work with?"
6323,4,3,JAIME,Cersei is the mother of the king. She has the king’s ear and his trust. And the king has been speaking regularly with the High Sparrow about Queen Margaery and Ser Loras.
6324,4,3,CERSEI,"The High Sparrow seized power knowing full well we'd bicker amongst ourselves instead of seizing it back. Here we are. Well done to us. Now the future of the Seven Kingdoms rest in his dirty, peasant hands. In a few days, he’ll have a trial for me. But before that, Queen Margaery will make her walk of atonement. Yes, Margaery will repent her sins before the good people of the city."
6325,4,3,OLENNA,"Oh, no. That cannot happen. That will not happen. CERSEi: I agree. JAIME (to KEVAN): You’ve got the second largest army in Westeros. You'll bring them into the city, stop queen Margaery’s humiliation before it starts, and take her back into Crown custody."
6326,4,3,KEVAN,The king has ordered me to take no action against the High Sparrow or the Faith Militant out of fear for the queen’s safety.
6327,4,3,JAIME,"You’ll take no action at all. When the Tyrell armies come, you will stand down. Are you expressly forbidden from standing down?"
6328,4,3,KEVAN,"No, but if the king should call on me --"
6329,4,3,JAIME,"The whole thing will be over before anyone can call on you to do anything. When the High Sparrow is in custody or dead, preferably, and Margaery's back at Tommen’s side, do you think the king will be angry at the outcome?"
6330,4,3,CERSEI,You hate these fanatics as much as we do. You hate what they’ve done to your son.  Do you want Lancel back or have you given him up for good?
6331,4,3,KEVAN,Of course I want him back.
6332,4,3,CERSEI,Then stand aside and let the people that took him from you be destroyed.
6333,4,3,KEVAN,"If it doesn’t go as planned, the Sparrows have many friends in the city. We’ll have civil war. Many will die."
6334,4,3,OLENNA,Many will die no matter what we do. Better them than us. EXT. IRON ISLANDS - HARBOR THEON approaches Pyke Castle by boat.
6335,4,3,TO,PYKE CASTLE – GREAT HALL THEON enters. YARA is sitting by the fire.
6336,4,3,YARA,"They told me you were home and I didn’t believe it. “Theon Greyjoy?” I said. “He’s dead. He’s been dead a long time."" He let you go?"
6337,4,3,THEON,I escaped. YARA turns and looks at THEON.
6338,4,3,YARA,I can’t hear you.
6339,4,3,THEON,I escaped. YARA stands up and then walks towards THEON.
6340,4,3,YARA,Look at me. Look at me! Men died trying to rescue you. Good men. My men.
6341,4,3,THEON,I’m sorry.
6342,4,3,YARA,"You were my brother. You’re a spoiled little cunt, but you were my brother and I risked everything for you and you betrayed me."
6343,4,3,THEON,I know. I know and I’m sorry.
6344,4,3,YARA,Stop saying that.
6345,4,3,THEON,He broke me. He broke me into a thousand pieces.
6346,4,3,YARA,I know.
6347,4,3,THEON,You don’t know.
6348,4,3,YARA,He send us one of those pieces. That’s why I came for you. THEON sobs.
6349,4,3,YARA,Why did you come here?
6350,4,3,THEON,Where else could I go?
6351,4,3,YARA,You heard father was dead and thought you’d claim the crown?
6352,4,3,THEON,"No, no. I only heard he died after we docked."
6353,4,3,YARA,You happen to show up on Pyke right before the Kingsmoot?
6354,4,3,THEON,I didn’t know.
6355,4,3,YARA,You think any Ironborn wants you to be king? After what you’ve done?
6356,4,3,THEON,I don’t want to be king.
6357,4,3,YARA,What do you want?
6358,4,3,THEON,I should’ve listened to you. You’re the only one --
6359,4,3,YARA,That doesn’t matter anymore. Stop crying.  Look at me. Tell me what you want.
6360,4,3,THEON,You should rule the Iron Islands. Let me help you. INT. WINTERFELL – ROOM RAMSAY peels an apple with a knife. The door opens. A guard ushers OSHA into the room. RAMSAY nods. The guard leaves and closes the door.
6361,4,3,RAMSAY,They've cleaned you up nicely. You know who I am?
6362,4,3,OSHA,A lord?
6363,4,3,RAMSAY,Yes. A lord. You’ve seen my banners?
6364,4,3,OSHA,The flayed man.
6365,4,3,RAMSAY,Does that worry you at all?
6366,4,3,OSHA,You eat them after?
6367,4,3,RAMSAY,No.
6368,4,3,OSHA,Then I’ve seen worse. RAMSAY peels the skin of the apple and puts it on the table with the knife. OSHA looks at the knife.  RAMSAY waves for OSHA to come to him. She walks towards him.
6369,4,3,RAMSAY,You served the Starks?
6370,4,3,OSHA,"Aye. They put me in chains and put a sword at my throat, so I’ve served them."
6371,4,3,RAMSAY,"The Starks have been gone for a long time, but you kept protecting Rickon."
6372,4,3,OSHA,"He'd fetch a good price to the right buyer. I served his family a long time. Didn’t get no wages. Way I see it, I’m owed."
6373,4,3,RAMSAY,"Be that as it may, Rickon's not yours to sell anymore. He’s mine. So what use could I possibly have for you?"
6374,4,3,OSHA,I can give you what you want.
6375,4,3,RAMSAY,Are you sure you know what that is? OSHA comes closer and sits down on his lap. They kiss.
6376,4,3,OSHA,"Same thing men always want. And when they really want it, they give it a bath first. OSHA slowly begins to reach for the knife on the table."
6377,4,3,RAMSAY,You’re a good talker. RAMSAY grabs OSHA by her hair and yanks her head back.
6378,4,3,RAMSAY,I like that. RAMSAY kisses OSHA'S neck. She reaches into his pants.
6379,4,3,RAMSAY,You’re a much better talker than Theon Greyjoy.
6380,4,3,OSHA,That so?
6381,4,3,RAMSAY,I had to work hard to get him talking. But he talked. They all do. OSHA's hand inches closer to the knife.
6382,4,3,RAMSAY,"He told me everything. All about the Stark boys. Who helped them escape, and how she did it. OSHA gets up and tries to stab RAMSAY with the knife, but RAMSAY stabs her in the neck first. She falls on the ground, with blood running from her neck. She dies. RAMSAY cleans his knife and continues to peel the apple. He bites a piece. EXT. CASTLE BLACK – COURTYARD"
6383,4,3,MAN,Open the gate! The gate opens and a knight from the Bolton family enters.
6384,4,3,TO,"CASTLE BLACK – MESS HALL SANSA, JON SNOW, BRIENNE, TORMUND, and DOLOROUS EDD are eating at a table. SANSA looks at the meat on her fork. JON SNOW, DOLOROUS EDD, and TORMUND eat vigorously. BRIENNE looks around at the men eating. TORMUND stares intently at BRIENNE. BRIENNE looks away. TORMUND smiles. DOLOROUS EDD notices their interaction. DOLOROUS EDD (to SANSA): Sorry about the food. It’s not what we’re known for."
6385,4,3,SANSA,That’s all right. There are more important things. A Night's Watchman enters the room and holds out a scroll to JON SNOW.
6386,4,3,MAN,"A letter for you, Lord Commander."
6387,4,3,SNOW,I’m not Lord Commander anymore. JON SNOW takes the letter. The man leaves. JON SNOW sees the seal of House Bolton. He opens the scroll and starts reading.
6388,4,3,SNOW,"""To the traitor and bastard Jon Snow. You allowed thousands of wildlings past the Wall. You have betrayed your own kind. You have betrayed the North. Winterfell is mine, bastard. Come and see. Your brother Rickon is in my dungeon. JON SNOW looks at SANSA."
6389,4,3,SNOW,"His direwolf's skin is on my floor. Come and see. I want my bride back. Send her to me, bastard, and I will not trouble you or your wildling lovers. Keep her from me and I will ride north and slaughter every wildling man, woman, and babe living under your protection. You will watch as I skin them living. You --"
6390,4,3,SANSA,Go on.
6391,4,3,SNOW,"It's just more of the same. JON SNOW puts the letter away, but SANSA takes it and continues reading."
6392,4,3,SANSA,"""You will watch as my soldiers take turns raping your sister. You will watch as my dogs your wild little brother. Then I will spoon your eyes from their sockets and let my dogs do the rest. Come and see. Ramsay Bolton, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North."
6393,4,3,SNOW,Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North.
6394,4,3,SANSA,His father's dead. Ramsay killed him. And now he has Rickon.
6395,4,3,SNOW,We don’t know that.
6396,4,3,SANSA,"Yes, we do."
6397,4,3,TORMUND,How many men does he have in his army?
6398,4,3,SANSA,"I heard him say 5,000 once when he was talking about Stannis’s attack. JON SNOW (to TORMUND): How many do you have?"
6399,4,3,TORMUND,"That can march and fight? 2,000. The rest are children and old people. SANSA (to JON SNOW): You're the son of the last true Warden of the North. Northern families are loyal. They’ll fight for you if you ask. SANSA takes JON SNOW's hand."
6400,4,3,SANSA,A monster has taken our home and our brother. We have to go back to Winterfell and save them both. JON SNOW nods. INT. VAES DOTHRAK – TEMPLE OF THE DOSH KHALEEN All the khals are gathered in council. They speak in Dothraki.
6401,4,3,MORO,It is forbidden to spill blood in the sacred city. It is forbidden to carry weapons in the sacred city. KHAL #1: So we don’t spill blood.
6402,4,3,MORO,Well… there’s always a little blood. KHAL #1: Someone crushed his head with a rock.
6403,4,3,MORO,Aggo belonged to my khalaser. He served me well. He got his head smashed in by a rock. Fuck Aggo. KHAL #1 sits down.
6404,4,3,MORO,"Bring in Drogo’s widow. DAENARYS enters, ushered by the Lhazareen woman and the leader of the Dosh Khaleen. The khals bow their heads. KHAL #2: Who cares about her? She’s a midget. KHAL #1: I like her. KHAL #2: She’s paler than milk. KHAL #3: I’d like to know what a khaleesi tastes like. KHAL #1: Good. You can suck my dick. The Khals laugh."
6405,4,3,MORO,"She belongs with the Dosh Khaleen. KHAL #4: The Wise Masters of Yunkai want her. They’re offering ten thousand horses In exchange. What's worth more, one pink little girl or ten thousand horses?"
6406,4,3,MORO,Fuck the Wise Masters in their perfumed asses. I’ll take their horses for myself.
6407,4,3,DAENERYS,Don’t you want to know what I think? All the khals raise their heads and stare at DAENERYS
6408,4,3,MORO,You’d rather be sold to slavery? Or maybe you’d like to show Rhalko here what you taste like?
6409,4,3,DAENERYS,No. I don’t want either of those things.
6410,4,3,MORO,"We don’t care what you want. This is the Temple of the Dosh Khaleen. You have no voice here, unless you are Dosh Khaleen. Which you are not, until we decide you are."
6411,4,3,DAENERYS,I know where I am. I have been here before. This is where the Dosh Khaleen pronounced my child the Stallion Who Mounts the World.
6412,4,3,MORO,"And what happened? You trusted a sorceress, like a fool. Your baby is dead because of you. And so is Khal Drogo."
6413,4,3,DAENERYS,This is where Drogo promised to take his khalasar west to where the world ends. To ride wooden horses across the Black Salt Sea as no khal has done before. He promised to kill the men in their iron suits and tear down their stone houses. He swore to me before the Mother of Mountains.
6414,4,3,MORO,And you were dumb enough to believe him?
6415,4,3,DAENERYS,"And here, now, what great matters do the Great Khals discuss? Which little villages you’ll raid, how many girls you’ll get to fuck, how many horses you’ll demand in tribute. You are small men. None of you are fit to lead the Dothraki. But I am. So I will. The khals laugh."
6416,4,3,MORO,All right. No Dosh Khaleen for you. Instead we’ll take turns fucking you. And then we’ll let our bloodriders fuck you. KHAL MORO stands.
6417,4,3,MORO,"And If there’s anything left of you, we’ll give our horses a turn. You crazy cunt. Did you really think we would serve you? DAENERYS lays her hand on a fire pit."

6419,4,4,SANSA,Yes? A man of the Night’s Watch enters.
6420,4,4,MAN,"For you, my lady. The man hands SANSA a scroll. It bears the mockingbird sigil of House Baelish. SANSA unrolls the scroll and reads it."
6421,4,4,SANSA,How far is Mole’s Town?
6422,4,4,TO,MOLE’S TOWN - SHACK LITTLEFINGER is standing in the center of the room. SANSA and BRIENNE enter. LITTLEFINGER turns to greet them.
6423,4,4,LITTLEFINGER,"Sansa. Lady Brienne. When I heard you had escaped WInterfell, I feared the worst. You have no idea how happy I am to see you unharmed."
6424,4,4,SANSA,Unharmed? What are you doing here?
6425,4,4,LITTLEFINGER,I rode north with the Knights of the Vale to come to your aid. They’re encamped at Moat Cailin as we speak.
6426,4,4,SANSA,"To come to my aid? Did you know about Ramsay? If you didn’t know, you’re an idiot. If you did know, you’re my enemy. SANSA steps closer to LITTLEFINGER."
6427,4,4,SANSA,"Would you like to hear about our wedding night? He never hurt my face. He needed my face, the face of Ned Stark’s daughter. But the rest of me, he did what he liked with the rest of me as long as I could still give him an heir. What do you think he did?"
6428,4,4,LITTLEFINGER,I can’t begin to contemplate --
6429,4,4,SANSA,What do you think he did to me?
6430,4,4,BRIENNE,Lady Sansa asked you a question.
6431,4,4,LITTLEFINGER,He beat you.
6432,4,4,SANSA,"Yes, he enjoyed that. What else do you think he did?"
6433,4,4,LITTLEFINGER,"Sansa, I --"
6434,4,4,SANSA,What else?
6435,4,4,LITTLEFINGER,Did he cut you?
6436,4,4,SANSA,Maybe you did know about Ramsay all along.
6437,4,4,LITTLEFINGER,I didn’t know.
6438,4,4,SANSA,I thought you knew everyone’s secrets.
6439,4,4,LITTLEFINGER,"I made a mistake, a horrible mistake. I underestimated a stranger."
6440,4,4,SANSA,"The other things he did, ladies aren’t supposed to talk about those things, but I imagine brothel keepers talk about them all the time. I can still feel it. I don’t mean in my tender heart it still pains me so. I can still feel what he did in my body standing here right now."
6441,4,4,LITTLEFINGER,I’m so sorry.
6442,4,4,SANSA,You said you would protect me.
6443,4,4,LITTLEFINGER,And I will. You must believe me when I tell you that I will.
6444,4,4,SANSA,I don’t believe you anymore. I don’t need you anymore. You can’t protect me. You won’t even be able to protect yourself if I tell Brienne to cut you down. And why shouldn’t I?
6445,4,4,LITTLEFINGER,"Do you want me to beg for my life? If that’s what you want, I will. Whatever you ask that is in my power, I will do."
6446,4,4,SANSA,What if I want you to die here and now?
6447,4,4,LITTLEFINGER,Then I will die.
6448,4,4,SANSA,You freed me from the monsters who murdered my family and you gave me to other monsters who murdered my family. Go back to Moat Cailin. My brother and I will take back the North on our own. I never want to see you again.
6449,4,4,LITTLEFINGER,I would do anything to undo what’s been done to you. I know that I can’t. Will you allow me to say one more thing before I go? Your great-uncle Brynden the Blackfish has gathered what remains of the Tully forces and retaken Riverrun. You might consider seeking him out. The time may come when you need an army loyal to you.
6450,4,4,SANSA,I have an army.
6451,4,4,LITTLEFINGER,Your brother’s army. LITTLEFINGER walks beside SANSA.
6452,4,4,LITTLEFINGER,"Half-brother. LITTLEFINGER exits. INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE - TRAINING ROOM ARYA and the WAIF are dueling with staves atop the sparring platform. They both strike many blows, all of them deflected by the other. The WAIF feigns and trips ARYA with a blow to the back of the legs. ARYA falls to the ground. The WAIF points her staff in ARYA’s face."
6453,4,4,WAIF,"You’re not ready. You should go home before it’s too late. The WAIF begins to walk away. ARYA jumps to her feet. The WAIF turns around and drops her staff, then approaches ARYA. ARYA swings at the WAIF several times, but the WAIF dodges and redirects the blows. The WAIF kicks ARYA in her midsection, sending her off the platform. ARYA hops back on the platform and advances. The WAIF disarms ARYA and punches her multiple times, knocking her off the platform and onto the ground."
6454,4,4,WAIF,"You’ll never be one of us, Lady Stark. The Faceless Man taking on the visage of JAQEN H’GHAR appears."
6455,4,4,JAQEN,She has a point. JAQEN walks away. ARYA follows. They enter the Hall of Faces.
6456,4,4,JAQEN,None of the first Faceless Men were born to lords and ladies. They began as slaves in the mines of Valyria.
6457,4,4,ARYA,Who was the first?
6458,4,4,JAQEN,"He was no one. The Many-Faced God taught him how to shed his face and how to give the gift. The man taught others in exchange for their service. Many served, many more gifts were given. Soon all the masters and overseers were gone and the Faceless Men fled."
6459,4,4,ARYA,Where did they go?
6460,4,4,JAQEN,"Here. They founded the Free City of Braavos and built this house. These were the faces they wore in life when they were not wearing others. The first Faceless Men. And now a girl is one of them, if a girl desires."
6461,4,4,ARYA,A girl has no desires. JAQEN holds up a small bottle.
6462,4,4,ARYA,Who? ARYA takes the bottle.
6463,4,4,JAQEN,"An actress who calls herself Lady Crane. She performs at the theater in Sheelba Square. A girl has been given a second chance. There will not be a third. One way or another, a face will be added to the hall."
6464,4,4,TO,"BRAAVOS - SHEELBA SQUARE Actors are performing a play. An audience has gathered to watch. ARYA is among them. On stage, an actor named IZEMBARO dressed as ROBERT BARATHEON walks back and forth. Two prop men mirror his movements, carrying a tarp that displays a forest landscape. Another prop man carries a cut-out of a boar and rams it into the actor’s rear end. The sound man makes a farting noise."
6465,4,4,IZEMBARO,"Ahh! ARYA laughs along with the crowd. The prop man strikes IZEMBARO with the boar prop again, this time in front. The actor recoils and the prop men replace the forest background with a black background."
6466,4,4,IZEMBARO,"Oh, murdered by a boar. The great big hairy whore. He dug in his tusks and dug out my guts and soon I am no more. IZEMBARO produces an intestine prop from his garb. He staggers, but is supported by another actor, CLARENZO, portraying JOFFREY."
6467,4,4,CLARENZO,"Oh, come, Father, in bed you must lie. I love you, Father. Please don’t die. IZEMBARO prop slaps CLARENZO. ARYA laughs with the crowd."
6468,4,4,IZEMBARO,"Shut up, you swine! Cersei, more wine. The actor portraying Joffrey falls to his knees in the front of the stage. LADY CRANE, portraying CERSEI, appears on the stage and walks to him."
6469,4,4,RANE,"I feel the winds of winter as they lick across the land. And our son alone on that cold, cold throne without a guiding hand. Who will teach him strength? Who will teach him grace? To whom will he turn when it’s time to learn to look darkness in the face?"
6470,4,4,IZEMBARO,"Ned stark will do fine. Now bring me more wine. BOBONO, portraying TYRION, appears and fills his glass. CAMELLO, portraying NED, appears and adjusts his crotch."
6471,4,4,CAMELLO,"Ooh! Ooh, what’s happened here, then?"
6472,4,4,BOBONO,"He brought you here, Ned Stark, ‘cause you’re the brightest fellow in the land. You should be king of us all and I should be your Hand."
6473,4,4,CAMELLO,We men of the North are right good hands at keeping people lawful. CAMELLO gestures to IZEMBARO.
6474,4,4,CAMELLO,"I’d ask him for permission, but he smells too bloody awful. The crowd laughs. ARYA looks around at them. She does not laugh."
6475,4,4,IZEMBARO,"I die! I die! And here I now must lie. Oh, woe. Oh, no. Oh, I am about to go. The sound man makes a farting noise."
6476,4,4,CRANE,Will you stay on as Joffrey’s Hand?
6477,4,4,CAMELLO,The Iron Throne’s what I demand.
6478,4,4,CRANE,You cannot.
6479,4,4,CAMELLO,I can.
6480,4,4,CRANE,You will not.
6481,4,4,CAMELLO,I will.
6482,4,4,CRANE,You dare not.
6483,4,4,CAMELLO,I dare yes.
6484,4,4,CRANE,The line of succession.
6485,4,4,CAMELLO,What’s that mean?
6486,4,4,CRANE,The proper progression.
6487,4,4,CAMELLO,What’s that mean?
6488,4,4,CRANE,The lawful ascension.
6489,4,4,CAMELLO,What’s that mean? The crowd laughs. Music plays. The crowd claps and cheers. The actors change scenes. CLARENZO is sitting on a cut-out of the Iron Throne. LADY CRANE and CAMELLO are standing next to him. BOBONO stands off to the side on a step stool.
6490,4,4,CAMELLO,"So move along, give me my chair and there won’t be no more trouble. CLARENZO prop slaps CAMELLO. CAMELLO stumbles into the grasp of BOBONO, who sends him to his knees."
6491,4,4,CAMELLO,But we had a deal all done and dusted. Two prop men carrying spears lift CAMELLO to his feet.
6492,4,4,CAMELLO,"I’m starting to think you can’t be trusted. The prop men usher CAMELLO offstage. As they change the scene, CLARENZO and LADY CRANE take center stage. LADY CRANE dons CLARENZO with a crown. In a new scene, CAMELLO is on a cut-out chopping block. CLARENZO and LADY CRANE stand to one side, and a prop man dressed as an executioner stands on the other. BIANCA, portraying Sansa, appears."
6493,4,4,BIANCA,Save my father.
6494,4,4,CRANE,Truly you should. Killing the man will do you no good.
6495,4,4,BIANCA,"Save him, please."
6496,4,4,CRANE,Show him mercy. Show the people what a good king should be.
6497,4,4,CLARENZO,"Good people, you may all relax. My father’s friend shall be spared the — The prop man portraying the executioner swings his axe. CAMELLO ducks behind the chopping block and tosses out a prop head."
6498,4,4,BIANCA,"Father! No! Oh, father. BIANCA takes the prop head. The executioner prop man wrenches the head from her grasp and tosses it to the other prop men."
6499,4,4,BOBONO,"Worry not! All is well. I have here a decree from my father Tywin Lannister, the richest man you’ll see. He proclaims me Hand of the King. The position’s mine for life. And he’s give me permission to take Sansa as my wife. He prop slaps CLARENZO in the face."
6500,4,4,BOBONO,"You’ll learn that what I lack in height I make up for in appetite. He rips open her shirt, exposing her breasts."
6501,4,4,BOBONO,"So let’s forget about your plight, and go rehearse our wedding night."
6502,4,4,TO,"BACKSTAGE All the actors from the play are gathered together, taking a break and attending to their costumes. The director, IZEMBARO, joins them. CLARENZO is examining his penis."
6503,4,4,CLARENZO,It’s a wart. Two warts. I’ve got two fucking warts on my cock.
6504,4,4,CAMELLO,"Well, don’t worry, love. They usually go away in five or six years. CAMELLO approaches ARYA and tosses her his costume cloak."
6505,4,4,CAMELLO,"Oh, wash this, darling. It stinks of me. IZEMBARO (to BIANCA): You can do better, Bianca, dear. You must do."
6506,4,4,BIANCA,I had two lines.
6507,4,4,IZEMBARO,There are no small parts. You rang very false.
6508,4,4,BIANCA,I rang very false?
6509,4,4,BOBONO,"What you need, love, is for someone to ring you true. BIANCA slaps BOBONO upside the head. BIANCA (to IZEMBARO): You weren’t complaining about me last night. BOBONO approaches LADY CRANE."
6510,4,4,BOBONO,"May I get you some wine, Lady Crane?"
6511,4,4,CRANE,"I’m a rum girl, Bobono. You need to know that if we’re going to be intimate."
6512,4,4,BOBONO,Of course we’re going to be intimate.
6513,4,4,CRANE,It’s only a matter of time. LADY CRANE uncorks her bottle of rum and pours herself a glass. The holds her drink up to BOBONO.
6514,4,4,CRANE,To our children.
6515,4,4,BOBONO,May they have your talent.

6518,4,4,ARYA,A girl will poison the rum. Lady Crane is the only one who drinks it. JAQEN looks at ARYA and nods.
6519,4,4,ARYA,If a girl could use one of the faces from the hall…
6520,4,4,JAQEN,A girl is not ready.
6521,4,4,ARYA,She’s a good actress.
6522,4,4,JAQEN,So a man has heard.
6523,4,4,ARYA,Seems like a decent woman.
6524,4,4,JAQEN,Does death only come for the wicked and leave the decent behind?
6525,4,4,ARYA,No. Who wants her dead?
6526,4,4,JAQEN,That does not matter. The price was paid.
6527,4,4,ARYA,The younger actress. She’s jealous because Lady Crane is better.
6528,4,4,JAQEN,A girl must decide if she wants to serve the Many-Faced God.
6529,4,4,ARYA,A girl has decided.

6531,4,4,TO,"VISION OF THE PAST - UNKNOWN LAND BRAN and the THREE-EYED RAVEN are walking together. They approach a weirwood tree encircled by many stones. The stones form a spiral. A Child of the Forest runs between the stones. BRAN and the THREE-EYED RAVEN follow her. They find a group of the Children crouching in a circle, whispering to each other. LEAF stands, carrying a shard of dragonglass. She approaches a man who is bound to the weirwood tree."
6532,4,4,MAN,No! No! No! LEAF slowly drives the shard into the man’s heart until it disappears inside his chest. The man’s eyes turn blue.

6539,4,4,YARA,"I am Yara Greyjoy, daughter of Balon Greyjoy, King of the Iron Islands. I claim the Salt Throne. MAN #1: We’ve never had a queen. Not once."
6540,4,4,YARA,"There are many things we’ve never done. We’ve never made our mark upon the world. The great lords of Westeros pay us no mind until our little raids buzz through their kingdoms long enough to become a nuisance. Then they swat us down. They conquer us, humiliate us, and go right back to forgetting we exist."
6541,4,4,ALL,Aye!

6560,4,4,EURON,Niece. EURON looks at THEON and then walks up to him.
6561,4,4,EURON,"Nephew. Little Theon. EURON pats THEON on the cheek, then turns to face the crowd."

6564,4,4,YARA,"When did you return, Uncle?"
6565,4,4,EURON,A few days ago. I had some things to take care of. Long overdue.
6566,4,4,YARA,I’m glad you’re here. Now I know what my first act as queen will be. To execute the man who killed my father. The men murmur to each other.
6567,4,4,EURON,I did. I killed him. Threw him right over a rope bridge and watched him fall. He was leading us nowhere and we would still be heading there if it weren’t for me. No one loved him. No one wanted to follow him. He led ius into two wars we couldn’t win. I apologize to you all for not killing him years ago.
6568,4,4,THEON,"That would have been hard to do. You weren’t here. Last I heard, you were gallivanting around the world having a grand old time."
6569,4,4,EURON,Gallivanting? That the sort of thing you start to say once your dick gets chopped off? The Ironborn laugh.
6570,4,4,EURON,Did the great lord of Westeros teach you words like that?
6571,4,4,THEON,You were gone. Yara was here. Being Ironborn. Leading Ironborn. Getting ready to bring us back to glory.
6572,4,4,EURON,And how will she do that?
6573,4,4,YARA,I will build the largest fleet the world has ever seen.
6574,4,4,EURON,"Right idea, except I’m the one who’s going to build the Iron Fleet because I’m the one who knows how to use it. I’ve been all over the world. I’ve seen more of it than all of you combined. And across the sea there is a person who hates the great lords of Westeros just as much as we do. Someone with a large army, three large dragons, and no husband. I’m going to build that fleet and I’m going to gallivant right over and give it to Daenerys Targaryen along with my big cock. The Ironborn laugh."
6575,4,4,YARA,You’re going to seduce the Dragon Queen?
6576,4,4,EURON,I’m not going to seduce her. The Iron Fleet will seduce her. And together we’re going to take the Seven Kingdoms. I wasn’t born to be king. I paid the iron price and here I stand. The Ironborn cheer and chant EURON’s name. THEON and YARA exchange a glance.

6579,4,4,AERSON,Listen to the waves. Listen to the god. He is speaking to us and he says we shall have no king but Euron Greyjoy. Let the sea wash your follies and your vanities away. Let the old Euron drown. Let his lungs fill with seawater. EURON drowns.

6581,4,4,AERON,"What is dead may never die, but rises again harder and stronger. AERON releases his grip on EURON. Two Ironborn carrying EURON onto shore. AERON and the other Ironborn gathered in attendance all stare at EURON. EURON does not move.One man begins to walk closer to him. EURON gags and coughs. He props himself up on his arms and legs, then spits up water and gasps for air. AERON retrieves a crown made of driftwood and places it on EURON’s head."
6582,4,4,AERON,What is dead may never die.

6585,4,4,AERON,They stole our best ships.
6586,4,4,EURON,Won’t be enough to save them. EURON turns to face the Ironborn.
6587,4,4,EURON,"Go back to your homes. Chop down every tree you can find. Quarter-saw the timber and start building. I want every man bending planks. I want every woman spinning flax for sails. Build me a thousand ships and I will give you this world. EXT. VAES DOTHRAK - CLIFFS DAENERYS stands at the edge of the cliff, looking out at Vaes Dothrak. She turns to face JORAH and DAARIO, who are standing behind her. DAENERYS (to JORAH): I banished you twice. You came back twice. And you saved my life. So I can’t take you back and I can’t send you away. DAENERYS approaches JORAH, but he recoils."

6593,4,4,DAENERYS,I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.
6594,4,4,JORAH,"Don’t be. All I’ve ever wanted was to serve you. Tyrion Lannister was right. I love you. I’ll always love you. Goodbye, Khaleesi. JORAH begins to walk away."
6595,4,4,DAENERYS,"Do not walk away from your queen, Jorah the Andal. JORAH turns back to face DAENERYS. She approaches him."
6596,4,4,DAENERYS,You have not been dismissed. You pledged yourself to me. You swore to obey my commands for the rest of your life. JORAH nods.
6597,4,4,DAENERYS,"Well, I command you to find the cure wherever it is in this world. I command you to heal yourself and then return to me. When I take the Seven Kingdoms, I need you by my side."

INT. MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM VARYS, MISSANDEI, and GREY WORM are gathered together. TYRION pours himself a glass of wine and joins them."
6599,4,4,VARYS,"In the last fortnight since our pact with the Masters, how many killings have been carried out by the Sons of the Harpy?"
6600,4,4,WORM,None.
6601,4,4,VARYS,And how many Masters have been butchered by the free men.
6602,4,4,WORM,"Two, but that was the day of the pact. Since then, nothing."
6603,4,4,VARYS,So it’s safe to say that a fragile peace has taken hold.
6604,4,4,WORM,For now.
6605,4,4,VARYS,For now is the best we get in our profession.
6606,4,4,TYRION,It’s not enough.
6607,4,4,VARYS,"Considering the city was on the brink of civil war, I’d say it’s a good start."
6608,4,4,TYRION,"It’s not enough for Meereen to have peace. They need to know Daenerys is responsible for it. The Sons of the Harpy have a good story. Resist the foreign invaders. Our queen has an even better story. Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains and...all that."
6609,4,4,MISSANDEI,The people know who brought them freedom.
6610,4,4,TYRION,"Yes, but do they know who brought them security? Who brought about an end to the violence? We need someone the people trust, someone they know who cannot be bought or influenced."
6611,4,4,VARYS,Sounds like quite the hero. Where would we find him?
6612,4,4,TYRION,Who said anything about “him”?
6613,4,4,TO,"MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBER TYRION and VARYS stand on the plateau above the audience chamber. A woman stans  at the bottom of the steps, and a man stand a few steps in front of her. MAN (speaking Valyrian): You stand in the presence of Kinvara, High Priestess of the Red Temple of Volantis, the Flame of Truth, the Light of Wisdom, the First Servant of the Lord of Light. The man steps aside. KINVARA walks up a few steps. TYRION (speaking Valyrian): Welcome to Meereen. KINVARA stops on the middle plateau."
6614,4,4,TYRION,That’s about the extent of my Valyrian. KINVARA says nothing.
6615,4,4,TYRION,Thank you for travelling all this way. I know from personal experience how uncomfortable the journey can be. TYRION looks at VARYS. KINVARA says nothing.
6616,4,4,TYRION,The truth is we need your help. We had hoped that we could somehow persuade you to --
6617,4,4,KINVARA,You don’t need to persuade me. I came to help. KINVARA continues up the steps.
6618,4,4,KINVARA,Daenerys Stormborn is the one who was promised. From the fire she was reborn to remake the world.
6619,4,4,TYRION,Yes.
6620,4,4,KINVARA,She has freed the slaves from their chains and crucified the Masters for their sins.
6621,4,4,TYRION,She did indeed.
6622,4,4,KINVARA,"Her dragons are fire made flesh, a gift from the Lord of Light. But you heard all this before, haven’t you? On the Long Bridge of Volantis. The dragons will purify nonbelievers by the thousands, burning their sins and flesh away."
6623,4,4,TYRION,Ideally we’d avoid purifying too many nonbelievers. The Mother of Dragons has followers of many different faiths.
6624,4,4,KINVARA,"You want your queen to be worshipped and obeyed. And while she’s gone, you want her advisors to be worshipped and obeyed."
6625,4,4,TYRION,I’d settle for obeyed.
6626,4,4,KINVARA,I will summon my most eloquent priests. They will spread the word. Daenerys has been sent to lead the people against the darkness in this war and in the great war still to come.
6627,4,4,TYRION,That sounds most excellent --
6628,4,4,VARYS,"A man named Stannis Baratheon was anointed as the chosen one by one of your priestesses. He, too, had a glorious destiny. He attacked King’s Landing and was soundly defeated by the man standing beside me. Last I had heard, he’d been defeated again, this time at Winterfell and this time for good."
6629,4,4,TYRION,We’d be most grateful for any support you could provide the queen.
6630,4,4,VARYS,I suppose it’s hard for a fanatic to admit a mistake. Isn’t that the whole point of being a fanatic? You’re always right. Everything is the Lord’s will.
6631,4,4,KINVARA,Everything is the Lord’s will. But men and women make mistakes. Even honest servants of the Lord.
6632,4,4,VARYS,"And you, an honest servant of the lord, why should I trust you to know any more than the priestess who counseled Stannis?"
6633,4,4,TYRION,"My friend has a healthy skepticism of religion, but we are all loyal supporters of the queen. VARYS nods. KINVARA takes two more steps. She is one step away from TYRION and VARYS."
6634,4,4,KINVARA,"Everyone is what they are and where they are for a reason. Terrible things happen for a reason. Take what happened to you, Lord Varys, when you were a child. If not for your mutilation at the hand of a second-rate sorcerer, you wouldn’t be here helping the Lord’s Chosen bring his light into the world. Knowledge has made you powerful. But there’s still so much you don’t know. Do you remember what you heard that night when the sorcerer tossed your parts in the fire? You heard a voice call out from the flames. Do you remember? Should I tell you what the voice said? KINVARA approaches VARYS and places her hand on his arm."
6635,4,4,KINVARA,Should I tell you the name of the one who spoke? VARYS scrunches up his face and stares at KINVARA. KINVARA smiles.
6636,4,4,KINVARA,"We serve the same queen. If you are her true friend, you have nothing to fear from me. KINVARA turns and walks back down the steps. INT. GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE BRAN lets a handful of sand run through his fingers. He lays back and then looks SUMMER, HODOR, and the THREE-EYED RAVEN. SUMMER and HODOR are sleeping, but the THREE-EYED RAVEN has his eyes open. BRAN picks up a wood chip and throws it at the THREE-EYED RAVEN. The THREE-EYED RAVEN does not stir. BRAN drags himself over to the roots of the tree and takes hold of them. His eyes turn white."
6637,4,4,TO,"VISION OF THE PAST - UNKNOWN LAND BRAN walks among the spiraling stones surrounding the weirwood tree from before, only now everything is covered in snow. He stares at the tree, then turns around. The army of the undead stands in attendance."
6638,4,4,BRAN,"What? BRAN walks towards them, and then among their ranks. They do not react. He inspects several of them as he walks by. On the other side of the army, he finds the Night King and four White Walkers on horseback. The Night King stares at him. BRAN turns around to find the entire army of the undead staring at him. When he turns back around, the Night King is standing right behind him. He recoils, but the Night King grabs his forearm. He screams."
6639,4,4,TO,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE BRAN screams as he releases the tree root and the vision ends. MEERA jumps to her feet.
6640,4,4,BRAN,"He saw me, the Night King! He saw me!"
6641,4,4,RAVEN,He touched you. LEAF and another Child of the Forest enter.
6642,4,4,BRAN,"I don’t know. He was close, but --"
6643,4,4,RAVEN,He touched you. BRAN pulls back his sleeve. There is a handprint on his forearm.
6644,4,4,RAVEN,He knows you are here. He’ll come for you.
6645,4,4,BRAN,But he can’t get in.
6646,4,4,RAVEN,"He can now. His mark is on you. You must leave, all of you."
6647,4,4,MEERA,"Come on, Hodor. Help me with the sledge."
6648,4,4,HODOR,Hodor.
6649,4,4,BRAN,I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to.
6650,4,4,RAVEN,The time has come.
6651,4,4,BRAN,The time for what?
6652,4,4,RAVEN,For you to become me.
6653,4,4,BRAN,But am I ready?
6654,4,4,RAVEN,"No. BRAN’s eyes turn white. INT. CASTLE BLACK - DINING HALL JON SNOW, SANSA, BRIENNE, DOLOROUS EDD, DAVOS, TORMUND, and MELISANDRE are gathered around a table. A map is spread out on the table with tokens indicating houses laid on its surface."
6655,4,4,SNOW,"We can’t defend the north from the Walkers and the south from the Boltons. If we want to survive, we need Winterfell, and to take Winterfell, we need more men."
6656,4,4,DAVOS,"Aside from the Starks and the Boltons, the most powerful houses in the North are the Umbers, the Karstarks, and the Manderlys. DAVOS stands and moves some of the tokens to Winterfell."
6657,4,4,DAVOS,"The Umbers and the Karstarks have already declared for the Boltons, so we’re not doing so well there."
6658,4,4,SANSA,The Umbers gave Rickon to our enemies. They can hang. But the Karstarks declared for Ramsay without knowing they had another choice.
6659,4,4,DAVOS,"I beg your pardon, my lady, but they know that a Stark beheaded their father. I don’t think we can count on them either."
6660,4,4,SANSA,"How well do you know the North, Ser Davos?"
6661,4,4,DAVOS,"Precious little, my lady."
6662,4,4,SANSA,"My father always said Northerners are different. More loyal, more suspicious of outsiders."
6663,4,4,DAVOS,"They may well be loyal, but how many rose up against the Boltons when they betrayed your family? I may not know the North, but I know men. They’re more or less the same in any corner of the world and even the bravest of them don’t want to see their wives and children skinned for a lost cause. If Jon’s going to convince them to fight alongside him, they need to believe it’s a fight they can win."
6664,4,4,SNOW,"There are more than three other houses in the North -- Glover, Mormont, Cerwyn, Mazin, Hornwood. Two dozen more. Together they equal all the others. We can start small and build."
6665,4,4,SANSA,"The North remembers. They remember the Stark name. People will still risk everything for it, from White Harbor to Ramsay’s own door."
6666,4,4,DAVOS,I don’t doubt it. But Jon doesn’t have the Stark name.
6667,4,4,SANSA,"No, but I do. JON SNOW stares at SANSA."
6668,4,4,SANSA,"Jon is every bit as much Ned Stark’s son as Ramsay is Roose Bolton’s. Ant there are also the Tullys. They’re not Northern, but they will back us against the Boltons without question."
6669,4,4,DAVOS,I didn’t know the Tullys still had an army.
6670,4,4,SANSA,My uncle the Blackfish has reformed it and retaken Riverrun.
6671,4,4,SNOW,How do you know that?
6672,4,4,SANSA,Ramsay received a raven before I escaped Winterfell.
6673,4,4,DAVOS,"That’s good. The Blackfish is a legend. His support would mean a great deal. Stark, Tully, a few more houses, almost starts to look like a winning side. SANSA smiles."
6674,4,4,TO,CASTLE BLACK - BALCONY BRIENNE follows SANSA down the stairs and along a walkway.
6675,4,4,BRIENNE,"I’ve sworn to protect you, my lady."
6676,4,4,SANSA,You heard them. We need more men and my uncle has an army.
6677,4,4,BRIENNE,We can send the Blackfish a raven.
6678,4,4,SANSA,Can’t risk Ramsay intercepting it. It has to be you. BRIENNE and SANSA enter SANSA’s chamber. BRIENNE closes the door behind them.
6679,4,4,SANSA,Ride for Riverrun. My uncle will talk to you and you’ll know how to talk to him. SANSA sits down on her bed.
6680,4,4,SANSA,What is it?
6681,4,4,BRIENNE,I don’t like leaving you here alone.
6682,4,4,SANSA,With Jon?
6683,4,4,BRIENNE,"Not him. He seems trustworthy. A bit brooding, perhaps. I suppose that’s understandable, considering. The others, though. Davos and the Red Woman helped a man murder his own brother with blood magic. And when Stannis paid for his crime, where were they? Already out looking for a leader with better prospects. And that wildling fellow with the beard --"
6684,4,4,SANSA,"Jon isn’t Tormund. Jon isn’t Davos, the Red Woman, or Stannis for that matter. Jon is Jon. He’s my brother. He’ll keep me safe. I trust him."
6685,4,4,BRIENNE,Then why did you lie to him when he asked you how you learned about Riverrun?
6686,4,4,TO,"CASTLE BLACK - COURTYARD Several men of the Night’s Watch are readying horses. JON SNOW stands beside them. MELISANDRE sits on her horse behind them. BRIENNE walks past. SANSA approaches JON SNOW, carrying a bundled cloak."
6687,4,4,SNOW,New dress?
6688,4,4,SANSA,I made it myself. Do you like it?
6689,4,4,SNOW,"Year, it’s -- I like the wolf bit."
6690,4,4,SANSA,"Good, because I made this for you. SANSA hands JON SNOW the cloak. JON SNOW looks at it. The direwolf sigil of House Stark is pressed into the leather straps."
6691,4,4,SANSA,I made it like the one Father used to wear. As near as I can remember.
6692,4,4,SNOW,"Thank you, Sansa."
6693,4,4,SANSA,"You’re welcome. SANSA walks away. BRIENNE is sitting on horseback beside TORMUND. TORMUND stares at her. She catches him staring and looks away. He grins. DOLOROUS EDD approaches JON SNOW, who is donning his new cloak."
6694,4,4,SNOW,Don’t knock it down while I’m gone.
6695,4,4,EDD,I’ll do my best. They embrace.
6696,4,4,EDD,"Good luck. JON SNOW walks to his horse and climbs atop it. He leads SANSA, MELISANDRE, PODRICK, BRIENNE, TORMUND, and the rest of the party out through the southern gates. A man of the Night’s Watch approaches DOLOROUS EDD, who is watching them leave."
6697,4,4,MAN,"Should we close the gate, Lord Commander?"
6698,4,4,EDD,I’m not the Lord Comman -- The men of the Night’s Watch gather around DOLOROUS EDD.
6699,4,4,EDD,"Yeah, ahem, close the bloody gate. INT. GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE BRAN and the THREE-EYED RAVEN are both having a vision. MEERA and HODOR are preparing for travel."
6700,4,4,MEERA,"We can go home now, Hodor. Well, maybe not home home, but somewhere that isn’t a cave. HODOR chuckles."
6701,4,4,HODOR,Hodor.
6702,4,4,MEERA,Eat something that isn’t moss. I want an egg. How do you like ‘em? Boiled? Fried up with some butter? HODOR laughs.
6703,4,4,HODOR,Hodor.
6704,4,4,MEERA,With a rasher of bacon and some blood sausage.
6705,4,4,HODOR,"Hodor. MEERA notices she can see her breath. She looks at BRAN and then runs to the entrance of the cave. LEAF and the other Children of the Forest are gathered outside. Across the field, the Night King, three White Walkers, and the army of the dead are gathered. The Night King steps forward, kneels, and places his hand on the ground. A rift cracks through the ice all across the field and into the Great Weirwood Tree."
6706,4,4,LEAF,"Get Bran and run! MEERA runs back into the cave, retrieving a sword on the way back. The Night King unsheathes his blade and leads the White Walkers and the army of the dead towards the Great Weirwood. Inside, MEERA runs to BRAN and shakes him."
6707,4,4,MEERA,"Bran. Bran, wake up. Bran. HODOR sits in the corner, rocking back and forth."
6708,4,4,HODOR,Hodor. Hodor.
6709,4,4,MEERA,"Bran, wake up."
6710,4,4,TO,VISION OF THE PAST - WINTERFELL BRAN and the THREE-EYED RAVEN watch YOUNG NED and YOUNG BENJEN embrace. BRAN smiles.
6711,4,4,TO,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE MEERA hauls the sledge over to BRAN and tries to drag him onto it.
6712,4,4,MEERA,Hodor.
6713,4,4,HODOR,Hodor. Hodor.
6714,4,4,MEERA,"Help me! Outside, LEAF and the Children of the Forest throw magic spheres at the army of the undead. The spheres explode upon contact, killing some of the wights. With one of the last bombs, LEAF lights a half-circle of flame in front of the entrance to the cave. She and the Children of the Forest run inside. The Night King and the White Walkers approach the flame. The flame parts to let them pass, then reforms. The army of the dead cannot pass through the flame. They go around it and climb the crag to the top of the Great Weirwood. Inside, MEERA places BRAN on the sledge."
6715,4,4,TO,VISION OF THE PAST - WINTERFELL BRAN and the THREE-EYED RAVEN continue to watch. RICKARD (to YOUNG NED): Remember that you are a Stark. Comport yourself with dignity at the Vale and try to stay out of fights. NAN walks over to YOUNG HODOR and takes his arm.
6716,4,4,NED,"Yes, Father. RICKARD takes YOUNG NED by the chin."
6717,4,4,RICKARD,"But if you have to fight, win."
6718,4,4,TO,GREAT WEIRWOOD TREE - CAVE MEERA continues shaking BRAN.
6719,4,4,MEERA,"Bran! Bran, wake up! A wight falls through the ceiling. It advances on MEERA. MEERA grabs her sword and cuts it down. Another wight falls from the ceiling. MEERA recoils. SUMMER tackles it. MEERA drops her blade and returns to BRAN."
6720,4,4,MEERA,"Bran! Bran! Bran, wake up."
6721,4,4,HODOR,"Hodor. Hodor. LEAF enters and runs up to BRAN and MEERA. A third wight falls from the ceiling, suspended upside down by its feet. LEAF rushes over to it and beheads it with her knife."
6722,4,4,MEERA,You have to wake up. We need Hodor.
6723,4,4,HODOR,"Hodor. Hodor. Another wight rushes, but LEAF shoots it with an arrow. A Child of the Forest enters to combat another wight, but the wight knocks her down and kills her. LEAF shoots it with an arrow."
6724,4,4,HODOR,Hodor. A number of wights begin piling in. LEAF and the Children of the Forest try to fight them off. One wight kills another Child of the Forest.
6725,4,4,MEERA,"Bran, we’re all going to die!"
6726,4,4,TO,"VISION OF THE PAST - WINTERFELL BRAN hears MEERA shouting at him from the other side. MEERA (V.O.): Bran, wake up! We’re all going to die! Bran! Bran!"

Another Child of the Forest  jumps forward and stabs another wight with a spear. HODOR stands and walks over to BRAN.  A White Walker enters. The spear-bearing Child of the Forest lunges at it and stabs it in the chest, but the blow has no effect. The White Walker pushes the spear aside and stabs the Child of the Forest, killing her. HODOR lifts the sledge with BRAN atop it. MEERA grabs a dragonglass spear and launches it into the White Walker’s neck. The White Walker shatters and dies. MEERA and LEAF follow HODOR towards the back entrance. SUMMER growls and bares his teeth at the wights entering the cave."
6734,4,4,MEERA,Summer!
6735,4,4,LEAF,"Go. Go! LEAF and MEERA run into the back tunnel. SUMMER attacks the wights. The wights encircle him and stab him to death. LEAF, MEERA, and HODOR hurry down the back tunnel.

6740,4,4,LEAF,"Go! LEAF turns to face the undead. She brandishes a magic bomb and primes it. The wights overtake her and knock her to the ground, stabbing her repeatedly. LEAF detonates the bomb, killing herself and the wights surrounding her. HODOR reaches the rear door. He puts down the sledge and begins ramming the door. More wights appear and begin advancing."
6741,4,4,MEERA,"Hodor, hurry! HODOR heaves the door open and drags the sledge outside. He drops the sledge and returns to the door, holding it closed. MEERA lifts the sledge and begins dragging it away."

6752,4,5,DEFAULT,"Blood of My Blood (Script) Lyrics TITLE SEQUENCE EXT. BEYOND THE WALL Heavy snow is falling. MEERA is dragging BRAN’s sledge through the forest. BRAN’s eyes are glazed white. He experiences many visions of the past all at once. MEERA staggers and falls against the base of a tree. She puts all her weight into pulling the sledge, but it does not budge. She begins crying and goes to BRAN, cradling his head. BRAN continues to have rapid fire visions, then sees a group of wights running through the woods. He wakes up from the visions and looks at MEERA."
6753,4,5,BRAN,Meera. They found us. MEERA looks out into the woods and sees the group of wights. She begins crying and embraces BRAN.
6754,4,5,MEERA,"I’m so sorry. The wights converge on MEERA and BRAN. Moments before they reach them, a cloaked rider appears. The rider’s horse kicks one of the wights out of the way, then the rider extends a chain which lights on fire at the end. Two wights charge, and the rider hits them both with the chain, setting them on fire. A third wight tries to attack his horse, but the horse’s bulk rebuffs it into a tree and it crumbles. The rider plunges a chain-sickle into the chest of another wight, then rides forward, dragging the wight behind his horse. He sets another wight on fire with the chain, launching it into the air, and then approaches BRAN and MEERA."
6755,4,5,RIDER,"Come with me, now. A large group of wights approaches."
6756,4,5,RIDER,"The dead don’t rest. The rider leans down and hoists BRAN up onto his horse. MEERA takes the rider’s hand and joins them on the horse’s back. The three of them ride off into the forest with wights in pursuit. EXT. ROAD TO HORN HILL SAM, GILLY, and LITTLE SAMare riding in a carriage escorted by several soldiers. GILLY looks out the window. SAM is holding LITTLE SAM."
6757,4,5,GILLY,It’s so green.
6758,4,5,SAM,"Oh, yes. Once you get south of the Riverlands, very different sorts of trees start to take over. Maple, elm, beech, poplar. The odd willow. And of course now that summer’s over, you’ll start seeing the autumn colors coming in. Still, you’ll find more green here than anywhere else."
6759,4,5,GILLY,You’re nervous. You’re a nervous talker. SAM looks away.
6760,4,5,GILLY,That’s not any better being a nervous mute.
6761,4,5,SAM,"I didn’t think I’d ever come back here after my father made me renounce my title and inheritance and, well, threaten to kill me if I didn’t. A person just doesn’t feel welcome at that point. GILLY looks at LITTLE SAM."
6762,4,5,SAM,And I certainly didn’t expect to be introducing him to my family. So you know what to tell them.
6763,4,5,GILLY,That Little Sam is your baby.
6764,4,5,SAM,"Yes, now that’s very important. If he thinks that Little Sam is his grandchild, he’ll take you in. He’ll get an education. He’ll learn to read. And you can help teach him. Huh?"
6765,4,5,GILLY,What did you tell your family about me?
6766,4,5,SAM,I told them I met you in the North.
6767,4,5,GILLY,Did you tell them how far north?
6768,4,5,SAM,"Well, it wasn’t a very large piece of parchment."
6769,4,5,GILLY,You didn’t tell them where I’m really from? You didn’t tell them I’m a wildling?
6770,4,5,SAM,"The thing is...my father doesn’t like wildlings. He hoped I’d make a man of myself by “killing some bloody wildlings,” so it’s probably a good subject to avoid if at all possible. GILLY looks out the window."
6771,4,5,GILLY,I think we’re here. SAM looks out the window. The carriage is approaching the castle on Horn Hill.
6772,4,5,TO,"HORN HILL - COURTYARD A party of guests is lined up at the entrance to the castle courtyard. GILLY and SAM enter. GILLY is carrying LITTLE SAM. SAM’s mother, MELESS, and his sister, TALLA, descend a set of stairs and approach them."

6774,4,5,SAM,"Oh, hello, Mother."
6775,4,5,MELESSA,I never thought I’d see you again. You look wonderful.
6776,4,5,SAM,Oh. TALLA embraces SAM and he grunts.
6777,4,5,SAM,"Talla? Gods, you’re a woman now."
6778,4,5,TALLA,Father says I have to marry Symun Fossoway. He has yellow teeth- -
6779,4,5,MELESSA,"That’s enough, Talla."
6780,4,5,SAM,"Oh, um, Mother, this is Gilly. GILLY bows her head and curtsies."
6781,4,5,MELESSA,"Oh, my. You are lovely."
6782,4,5,GILLY,"I am happy to know you, Lady Tarly."
6783,4,5,SAM,"Oh, and this, this is our son Samwell. MELESSA and TALLA smile at each other. MELESSA approaches the baby and smiles."
6784,4,5,MELESSA,"Hello, little one. It’s me, your grandmother. LITTLE SAM smiles and touches MELESSA’s face."
6785,4,5,MELESSA,May I hold him?
6786,4,5,GILLY,"Yes, of course. GILLY passes LITTLE SAM to MELESSA. MELESSA (to LITTLE SAM): You have a curious mind, I can tell. You’ll be a scholar like your father."
6787,4,5,SAM,Where is Father? And Dickon?
6788,4,5,MELESSA,They’re on a hunt. They’ll join us for dinner. Come inside. Such a journey. You must be exhausted. MELESSA passes LITTLE SAM back to GILLY. SAM and MELESSA proceed up the steps. TALLA takes GILLY’s arm and they follow.
6789,4,5,TALLA,"Come, you’ll be wanting a bath after all that travel. Oh, and a dress for dinner. You can wear one of mine. What’s your color? Midnight blue or silver? Silver, maybe. Come. You can choose one of my bedrooms if you want. INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR TOMMEN and the HIGH SPARROW are standing in the central chamber. TOMMEN lights a candle."
6790,4,5,TOMMEN,Is there no other way?
6791,4,5,SPARROW,You’re afraid for her?
6792,4,5,TOMMEN,Of course I’m afraid for her! It just seems very dangerous.
6793,4,5,SPARROW,She’ll be protected the entire way. The Faith Militant are very stern with those who overstep their bounds. And Queen Margaery isn’t your mother. I suspect the gods will predispose the common people to gentleness on her behalf. She’s truly opened her heart to them.
6794,4,5,TOMMEN,She’s always been very devoted to the poor and the unfortunate.
6795,4,5,SPARROW,And now she’s devoted to the gods as well. Would you like to see her?
6796,4,5,TO,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM MARGAERY is sitting on a bench reading a book. The door opens. TOMMEN and the HIGH SPARROW are visible outside. TOMMEN enters and stares at MARGAERY. The HIGH SPARROW closes the door behind TOMMEN. MARGAERY sets down her book and stands. They embrace.
6797,4,5,TOMMEN,Have they hurt you? Have they mistreated you?
6798,4,5,MARGAERY,"No, Your Grace."
6799,4,5,TOMMEN,I’ve missed you. More than you could know.
6800,4,5,MARGAERY,We’ll be together again soon and everything will be better than it was before.
6801,4,5,TOMMEN,Better how? Soon the- - walk of atonement. He says there’s no other way.
6802,4,5,MARGAERY,"Have you spoken to him at all, the High Sparrow?"
6803,4,5,TOMMEN,"Yes, a few times. Have you?"
6804,4,5,MARGAERY,"Yes, I have. He’s not quite what we thought he was, is he? TOMMEN scrunches up his face. MARGAERY chuckles and turns away."
6805,4,5,MARGAERY,You think I’m mad. I sound mad.
6806,4,5,TOMMEN,"No. No, you don’t. You- - you could never. You’re right, he’s not. He’s a lot more- -"
6807,4,5,MARGAERY,He is. There’s something about him. His way of looking at the world. It’s not an easy thing admitting to yourself what you really are. It’s taken me a while. He’s helped me.
6808,4,5,TOMMEN,What are you talking about? You’re a good person. You’ve always been a good person. You’re the best person I know. MARGAERY chuckles and retrieves her book from the bench.
6809,4,5,TOMMEN,I was just telling him about your devotion to the poor.
6810,4,5,MARGAERY,"Ah, yes, I visited their hovels and I fed them soup and I made sure I was seen doing it. I never gave them what they really needed, though. I’ve had lots of time to think about how good I was at seeming good. All those stories I told myself about who I was and why I did the things I did. There were so many lies in those stories."
6811,4,5,TOMMEN,I don’t understand. MARGAERY rushes to TOMMEN and takes his hand.
6812,4,5,MARGAERY,It’s all right. It really is. It’s such a relief to let go of those lies. MARGAERY leads him to the bench and they sit down on it together.
6813,4,5,TOMMEN,What about Loras?
6814,4,5,MARGAERY,"I love my brother. I will always love my brother. His soul is pure and perfect. His sins don’t erase that purity, they only obscure it. He just needs to atone for them. We all do. Sooner or later, one way or another. The gods have a plan for us all. INT. HORN HILL - HALLWAY SAM paces. GILLY enters on the far end of the hall. She is wearing a dress and her hair is done up."
6815,4,5,GILLY,It’s hard to walk in this.
6816,4,5,SAM,It’s beautiful. You’re beautiful. GILLY takes SAM’s arm and they walk down the hall together.
6817,4,5,TO,"HORN HILL - DINING HALL SAM, GILLY, MELESSA, TALLA, DICKON, and RANDYLL are sitting around the dinner table eating. RANDYLL takes a bite and stares at SAM. GILLY looks around at others using their utensils and mimics them. SAM looks at DICKON."
6818,4,5,SAM,"This venison, it’s very tasty. Is it from today’s hunt?"
6819,4,5,DICKON,"Well, no. We haven’t been able to cure that one yet. This is last week’s."
6820,4,5,SAM,"Oh, of course. Sorry. Long journey."
6821,4,5,DICKON,Brought it down from 70 yards. One shot.
6822,4,5,SAM,"Oh, that’s a fair distance."
6823,4,5,DICKON,So do you do much hunting up at the wall?
6824,4,5,SAM,"Oh, yes. Yes. A good amount. North of the Wall, you don’t hunt, you don’t eat."
6825,4,5,DICKON,Mm-hmmm. Mostly deer or is it elk as well?
6826,4,5,SAM,"Rabbits. Sometimes squirrels. I say “we,” it’s my friend Jon mostly. Sometimes Edd. Oh, and Gilly. She’s- - she’s quite a good hunter as well. Um, huntress. MELESSA (to GILLY): I imagine it’s common where you’re from. We once met a man, Lord Umber from Last Hearth, wasn’t it, Randyll, who said he taught all his daughters how to hunt."
6827,4,5,TALLA,Your father taught you to hunt? Our father would never teach us. I think our father could learn a thing or two from your father.
6828,4,5,RANDYLL,That’s enough of that.
6829,4,5,MELESSA,"Samwell, would you care for more bread?"
6830,4,5,SAM,"Oh, yes. Yes, please. Thank you, Mother. A servant girl retrieves the basket of bread. She holds out the basket to SAM. SAM reaches for the bread."
6831,4,5,RANDYLL,Not fat enough already? SAM waves the servant away.
6832,4,5,SAM,I travelled south under orders from the Lord Commander. He wants me to- -
6833,4,5,RANDYLL,I read your letter. You’re to be a maester.
6834,4,5,SAM,"Yes. And once I have my chain, I’ll return to Castle Black."
6835,4,5,RANDYLL,I thought the Night’s Watch might make a man of you. Something resembling a man at least. You managed to stay soft and fat. SAM puts down his utensils.
6836,4,5,RANDYLL,Your nose buried in books. Spending your life reading about the achievements of better men. I’ll wager you still can’t sit a horse or wield a sword.
6837,4,5,MELESSA,"Randyll, to be maester of the Night’s Watch is a great honor."
6838,4,5,GILLY,He can wield a sword. He killed a Thenn. He killed a White Walker. DICKON laughs.
6839,4,5,DICKON,There’s no such thing.
6840,4,5,GILLY,I saw it with my own eyes on our way down to Castle Black. He drove a dagger into the walker’s heart. He risked his own life to save mine more than once. He’s a greater warrior than either of you will ever be.
6841,4,5,RANDYLL,Your way down to Castle Black? Where did he kill a white walker? Where are you from? How’d you come to meet my son?
6842,4,5,GILLY,The Night’s Watch came to our keep.
6843,4,5,RANDYLL,Where?
6844,4,5,SAM,Gilly.
6845,4,5,GILLY,North of the Wall.
6846,4,5,RANDYLL,North of the Wall? You’re a Wildling. The Seven Kingdoms have waged war against these savages for centuries and here I sit hosting one in my hall thanks to my son. See that sword? RANDYLL points to a blade mounted on a mantle beside the table.
6847,4,5,RANDYLL,"It’s called Heartsbane. It’s been in our family for 500 years. It’s Valyrian steel. Only a handful of them left in the world. It’s supposed to go to my firstborn son after I die. To him. He will never wield that sword. If he were to become Lord Tarly of Horn Hill, it would be the end of this house. I took you for a Mole’s Town whore when I saw you and I made my peace with that. Who else would have him? But I overestimated him. No. It was a wildling whore that seduced my son. This you getting back at me, boy? Hmm? Bring that to my table and making me dine with it. And you got what you were after, didn’t you? A bastard. A half-breed bastard. Your invitation into our home. MELESSA throws down her utensils and stands. She walks to GILLY."
6848,4,5,MELESSA,"Come, my dear. Talla. TALLA and GILLY stand and begin to follow MELESSA out of the hall."
6849,4,5,MELESSA,I’ve lost my appetite.
6850,4,5,RANDYLL,He dishonors us.
6851,4,5,MELESSA,"You dishonor yourself. RANDYLL (to SAM): Your mother’s a fine woman. You’re not worthy of her. To please her, I’ll take the wildling in. She can work in the kitchens. The bastard will be raised here. But this will be the last night you ever spend at Horn Hill."
6852,4,5,TO,HORN HILL - GILLY’S GUEST CHAMBER GILLY is sitting at the foot of the bed. LITTLE SAM is in a crib beside her. SAM stands before them both. He hangs his head.
6853,4,5,SAM,I’m sorry I let him treat you that way. I was afraid he’d turn you and Little Sam away.
6854,4,5,GILLY,I’m not angry at you. I’m angry that horrible people can treat good people that way and get away with it. When do you have to go?
6855,4,5,SAM,First light. LITTLE SAM fusses and reaches for SAM. SAM takes his hand.
6856,4,5,SAM,Say good-bye to him for me. SAM starts off but GILLY stands and gets in his way. She places her hands on his chest and kisses him.
6857,4,5,GILLY,"You’re not what he thinks you are, Sam. He doesn’t know what you are."
6858,4,5,SAM,"Good-bye, Gilly. SAM walks to the door. He turns back and stares at GILLY before closing the doors. GILLY looks around the guest chamber and then goes to LITTLE SAM. She pulls his blanket up higher and comforts him. SAM bursts back into the room."
6859,4,5,GILLY,Sam?
6860,4,5,SAM,We’re leaving.
6861,4,5,GILLY,What?
6862,4,5,SAM,Get your things.
6863,4,5,GILLY,I don’t have any things. SAM picks up LITTLE SAM.
6864,4,5,GILLY,What are you doing?
6865,4,5,SAM,We belong together. All of us.
6866,4,5,TO,HORN HILL - DINING CHAMBER SAM and GILLY walk briskly through the hall. GILLY is carrying LITTLE SAM.
6867,4,5,GILLY,What about your mother and sister?
6868,4,5,SAM,"Oh, they’ll understand."
6869,4,5,GILLY,Your sister’s dress. SAM grabs a stool and carries it in front of the mantle hosting Heartsbane.
6870,4,5,SAM,She won’t mind. Looks better on you anyway. SAM climbs on top of the stool.
6871,4,5,GILLY,Sam. That’s your father’s sword. SAM lifts Heartsbane off the mantle. He groans and slides it into its scabbard.
6872,4,5,SAM,It’s my family’s sword.
6873,4,5,GILLY,Sam. Won’t he come for it?
6874,4,5,SAM,"He can bloody well try. SAM hops down off the stool. EXT. BRAAVOS - SHEELBA SQUARE The acting troupe is putting on a repeat performance of The Bloody Hand, their play about the happenings of Westerosi royalty. AYRA is standing in the crowd in the front row. On stage is CLORENZO portraying JOFFREY, an actress portraying MARGAERY, BIANCA portraying SANSA, BOBONO portraying TYRION, and LADY CRANE portraying CERSEI. CLORENZO is at center stage, brandishing a prop sword."
6875,4,5,CLARENZO,The lion and the rose are one. I thank the gods above. The actress portraying MARGAERY runs to CLARENZO.
6876,4,5,CLARENZO,"And to you, my beauteous bridge, I pledge undying love."
6877,4,5,ALL,Hail King Joffrey. Hail Queen Margaery.
6878,4,5,CLARENZO,"I’ll drink a toast to my new queen, for there is no one fairer. Dear Uncle, will you share my joy and be my royal cupbearer? BOBONO approaches CLARENZO and hands him a prop cup."
6879,4,5,BOBONO,"Drink long and deep, my noble king, from this cup of sweet wine. CLARNEZO takes the prop cup and BOBONO walks to center stage, addressing the audience."
6880,4,5,BOBONO,"The last drink he shall ever take. And vengeance shall be mine. BOBONO laughs and the audience boos. CLARENZO takes a sip from the prop cup, then gags and sputters. The audience gasps. He moves to center stage."
6881,4,5,CLARENZO,Poison! Murder! I gasp. I- - I die. ARYA smiles and laughs in the crowd.
6882,4,5,CLARENZO,I limp. And it was he… CLARENZO points at BOBONO. BOBONO holds up a prop vial of poison. The audience gasps and boos.
6883,4,5,CLARENZO,...that poisoned me. My evil Uncle Imp. BOBONO laughs and exits with BIANCA. The audience boos. CLARENZO collapses and LADY CRANE kneels down beside him. ARYA laughs. LADY CRANE cradles the head of the actor portraying JOFFREY.
6884,4,5,CRANE,"My firstborn son. My golden lion foully, falsely slain. I pray you found a lasting peace free from strife and pain. ARYA’s smile fades."
6885,4,5,CRANE,"Hear my prayer, O cruel gods. Take my life instead. For I cannot face another day when my sweet boy is dead. Oh, woe. Oh grief. ARYA notices BIANCA standing offstage. BIANCA is watching LADY CRANE’s performance and mouths her lines as she utters them."
6886,4,5,CRANE,"Oh, darkest day, my heart is full of sorrow. All hope is lost. All joy is gone. And there is no tomorrow. LADY CRANE kisses CLARENZO’s cheek and lays his head down. The audience claps. The actors clear out the stage and the prop men change the scene. BOBONO enters carrying a prop crossbow. IZEMBARO, portraying TYWIN, is sitting on a prop toilet."
6887,4,5,BOBONO,What is that I hear and smell? Someone I’ll soon send to hell. ARYA leaves the front row and moves through the crowd.
6888,4,5,BOBONO,It’s time to see if truth they told who said Tywin Lannister shits gold. BOBONO pretends to shoot IZEMBARO with the crossbow. IZEMBARO cries out.
6889,4,5,IZEMBARO,You beast. You beast. You killed my wife and now you’ve taken your father’s life.
6890,4,5,TO,"SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE ARYA enters and walks further inward. On her way through the entrance hall, she sees the prop head the performers use for NED’s execution scene. IZEMBARO (O.S.): No worse child ever stained this land."
6891,4,5,TO,SHEELBA SQUARE STAGE
6892,4,5,IZEMBARO,Curse the day I named you. IZEMBARO groans as though dying and turns to the side. The sound guy makes a farting noise.
6893,4,5,BOBONO,My greatest crime. Now I must flee.
6894,4,5,TO,SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE ARYA walks into the actor’s break room. BOBONO (O.S.): Then sail across the Narrow Sea to do unto you more treachery. ARYA draws the curtain and stares at LADY CRANE’s bottle of rum. BOBONO (O.S.): Don’t fear the winter.
6895,4,5,TO,SHEELBA SQUARE STAGE
6896,4,5,BOBONO,Fear me! BOBONO shoots a prop arrow into the audience and laughs. The audience gasps and boos him offstage.
6897,4,5,TO,"SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE IZEMBARO (O.S.): Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Bianca, Clarenzo. ARYA retrieves a vial of from her satchel. She uncorks LADY CRANE’s bottle of rum."
6898,4,5,TO,"SHEELBA SQUARE STAGE IZEMBARO, BIANCA, and CLARENZO stand center stage."
6899,4,5,IZEMBARO,I give you Bobono. BOBONO enters the stage and the audience boos.
6900,4,5,IZEMBARO,I give you Camello.
6901,4,5,TO,"SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE ARYA pours the contents of the vial into LADY CRANE’s rum bottle and corks it. IZEMBARO (O.S.): And last but not least, sweet Lady Crane. On stage, LADY CRANE enters and bows. The crowd cheers wildly. AYRA hears the cheering. She tucks the away the vial, draws back the curtain, and exits the break room. The actors are all piling into the area. CAMELLO approaches ARYA in the entrance hallway and hands her his costume cloak."
6902,4,5,CAMELLO,Give this a good beating. Shake those fleas out. That’s a dear. IZEMBARO and BIANCA enter. IZEMBARO (to BIANCA): That crowd was shit. ARYA walks past them and puts down the cloak. She moves to leave. LADY CRANE enters and sees her.
6903,4,5,CRANE,Girl. ARYA stops on the steps and looks at LADY CRANE.
6904,4,5,CRANE,What are you doing back here?
6905,4,5,ARYA,Nothing.
6906,4,5,CRANE,I saw you the other day in the audience. How many times have you seen this stupid play?
6907,4,5,ARYA,Three times.
6908,4,5,CRANE,Did you pay? ARYA smiles.
6909,4,5,ARYA,No. ARYA walks off the steps to get out of the way of the prop men.
6910,4,5,CRANE,"I remember when the players came to my village. I didn’t have any money, so I snuck in. Just like you. Saw the painted faces, the costumes, listened to the songs, cried when the young lovers died in each other’s arms. I ran off and joined them the next day, never looked back."
6911,4,5,ARYA,You’re very good.
6912,4,5,CRANE,My final speech is shit. LADY CRANE takes ARYA by the waist and ushers her towards the break room.
6913,4,5,CRANE,"But to be fair to myself, which I always like to be, the writing’s no good. They stop in a side corridor."
6914,4,5,ARYA,"So change it. It would all just be farting, belching, and slapping without you."
6915,4,5,CRANE,How would you change it?
6916,4,5,ARYA,The queen loves her son more than anything. And he was taken from her before she could say good-bye. She wouldn’t just cry. She would be angry. She would want to kill the person who did this to her.
6917,4,5,CRANE,What’s your name?
6918,4,5,ARYA,Mercy.
6919,4,5,CRANE,"You have very expressive eyes, Mercy. ARYA smiles."
6920,4,5,CRANE,Wonderful eyebrows. Do you like pretending to be other people?
6921,4,5,ARYA,I have to go. My father’s waiting for me. ARYA exits. LADY CRANE enter the break room. BIANCA takes off her wig and notices LADY CRANE.
6922,4,5,BIANCA,"Lady Crane, they loved you. LADY CRANE removes her wig."
6923,4,5,CRANE,They were sweet. Or drunk. Drunkenly sweet.
6924,4,5,IZEMBARO,No laugh for Ned’s death. These people are worse than animals. IZEMBARO sips from a mug and gestures to LADY CRANE.
6925,4,5,IZEMBARO,But they loved her. They all love her. CAMELLO removes his wig and approaches LADY CRANE.
6926,4,5,CAMELLO,"Yes, you are adored by people and animals alike."
6927,4,5,CRANE,I do what I can with what I’m given.
6928,4,5,IZEMBARO,With what you’re given?
6929,4,5,CRANE,"Well, I was thinking- -"
6930,4,5,IZEMBARO,"Oh, we’re all thinkers now, are we? IZEMBARO stands, slaps his chest, and walks closer to LADY CRANE."
6931,4,5,IZEMBARO,Full to the tits with ideas.
6932,4,5,CRANE,I didn’t mean- -
6933,4,5,IZEMBARO,"You have ideas, I have ideas, he has ideas. Why should my ideas have any more value than yours simply because I’ve been doing this my whole life? Who is anyone to judge my work? This is my profession. I know what I’m doing. IZEMBARO removes his wig."
6934,4,5,IZEMBARO,"You have no right to an opinion. LADY CRANE brings a glass of rum to her lips. Just before she drinks, ARYA appears and slaps the glass out of her hands. Everyone in the room stares at ARYA. ARYA points at BIANCA."
6935,4,5,ARYA,Careful of that one. She wants you dead. ARYA exits. The WAIF is revealed to have been watching.
6936,4,5,TO,HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE - OUTSIDE ARYA pulls the stones away from where she hid Needle. She pulls Needle from inside the rocks and stares at it.
6937,4,5,TO,HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE - WASHING CHAMBER JAQEN is cutting the face of a corpse. The WAIF enters.
6938,4,5,JAQEN,And?
6939,4,5,WAIF,As I expected.
6940,4,5,JAQEN,A shame. A girl had many gifts. JAQEN begins lifting the face off of the corpse.
6941,4,5,WAIF,You promised me.
6942,4,5,JAQEN,Don’t let her suffer. The WAIF nods and exits. JAQEN pulls the face from the corpse.
6943,4,5,TO,"UNKNOWN ALLEY ARYA sets down a lit candle and brandishes Needle. She places Needle on the ground, sits down beside it, and blows out the candle. EXT. KING’S LANDING JAIME is wearing armor and sitting atop a horse. He watches as MACE TYRELL, also wearing armor, leads a force of many soldiers down the street. MACE stops in front of JAIME and the soldiers halt."
6944,4,5,MACE,My lord.
6945,4,5,JAIME,My lord. MACE turns his horse to face the soldiers.
6946,4,5,MACE,"My friends, the hour has come. Madness has overtaken this city and grasped in its claws my children. But now we must drive it back under the rocks whence it came. Madness has had its day! MACE turns his horse back the other way and nods at JAIME. JAIME nods back."
6947,4,5,CAPTAIN,"Forward, march!"
6948,4,5,TO,"GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - STEPS The HIGH SPARROW is standing on the steps beside MARGAERY and SEPTA UNELLA.. They are surrounded by Faith Militant, including LANCEL. The HIGH SPARROW is addressing a large gathering of commoners who stand at the foot of the steps."
6949,4,5,SPARROW,"Rich or poor, noble or common, if we win, we must atone. Margaery of House Tyrell came to us a sinner. She stood before the gods in the holy sept and lied. She turned a blind eye to her brother’s sins. She disgraces her house, the king, and herself. The crowd murmurs and parts. JAIME and MACE enter, leading the soldiers. MARGAERY gasps to herself. On the side, a smaller group of soldiers sets down a carriage. OLENNA steps out of the carriage."
6950,4,5,CAPTAIN,"Company, halt! Face front! Turn! The soldiers form up and turn to face the steps."
6951,4,5,SPARROW,Lord Tyrell. MACE nods at the HIGH SPARROW.
6952,4,5,SPARROW,Ser Jaime.
6953,4,5,JAIME,Sorry to interrupt. We’re here for Queen Margaery and Ser Loras Tyrell. Give them to us and we’ll be on our way.
6954,4,5,SPARROW,I don’t have the authority to give them to you. And you don’t have the authority to take them. The crowd murmurs. JAIME ushers his horse forward and rides it up the steps. He halts in front of the Faith Militant.
6955,4,5,CAPTAIN,Lock spears! The soldiers grunt and point their spears towards the Faith Militant.
6956,4,5,JAIME,"I speak for King Tommen of House Baratheon, First of His Name."
6957,4,5,SPARROW,The gods don’t recognize his authority in this matter.
6958,4,5,JAIME,You already insulted one great house. It won’t happen twice. Every last sparrow will die before Margaery walks down that street.
6959,4,5,SPARROW,"To die in the service of the gods would please each and every one of us. We yearn for it. But there is no call for it today. There will be no walk of atonement. The crowd murmurs. OLENNA motions to MACE with her fan. MACE motions to one of the high ranking soldiers, who nods to the Captain."
6960,4,5,CAPTAIN,Order up! The soldiers return to a relaxed position.
6961,4,5,SPARROW,"Queen Margaery has already atoned for her sins by bringing another into the true light of the Seven. The doors to the Great Sept of Baelor open. TOMMEN emerges, accompanied by the Kingsguard. The crowd murmurs. JAIME looks back at OLENNA, who looks down. TOMMEN and the Kingsguard walk down the steps until TOMMEN stands beside MARGAERY. TOMMEN takes MARGAERY’s hand."
6962,4,5,SPARROW,Together we announce a new age of harmony. A holy alliance between the Crown and the Faith. The crowd cheers.
6963,4,5,WOMAN,"Long live King Tommen and bless you, Queen Margaery! TOMMEN looks at JAIME. JAIME shakes his head. TOMMEN looks at the crowd."
6964,4,5,TOMMEN,The crown and the faith are the twin pillars upon which the world rests. Together we will restore the Seven Kingdoms to glory. The crowd cheers. MACE (to OLENNA): What’s happening?
6965,4,5,OLENNA,He’s beaten us. That’s what’s happening. The HIGH SPARROW smiles at JAIME.
6966,4,5,TO,"RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM The room is lined with soldiers on either side. TOMMEN is sitting on the throne. KEVAN stands beside him. JAIME stands at the foot of the throne and removes his armor, letting it drop to the floor."
6967,4,5,TOMMEN,"When you attack the Faith, you attack the Crown. Anyone who attacks the Crown is unfit to serve as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard."
6968,4,5,JAIME,I’ve been a member of the Kingsguard since before you were born. You don’t have to do this. You don’t have to do anything.
6969,4,5,TOMMEN,I have to answer to the gods.
6970,4,5,JAIME,Not when you’re sitting in that chair.
6971,4,5,TOMMEN,The Crown’s decision on this matter is final.
6972,4,5,JAIME,Will I be walking naked in the streets? Or will I spend a few months in the sept dungeons first to teach me about the gods’ mercy? TOMMEN and KEVAN look at each other.
6973,4,5,TOMMEN,"You have served your house and your king faithfully for many years. And you will continue to do so. But not in this city. THE CROSSING - DINING HALL WALDER FREY is sitting in a high chair addressing two of his sons, BLACK WALDER and LOTHAR. One of his young daughter stands beside him. Many other family members sit at the tables, eating."
6974,4,5,WALDER,You’ve lost it?
6975,4,5,WALDER,"Yes, father."
6976,4,5,WALDER,"It’s a castle, not a bloody sheep. Presumably you still know where it is. You didn’t lose Riverrun. You let the Blackfish take it from you."
6977,4,5,LOTHAR,He surprised us. He knows the castle better than anyone.
6978,4,5,WALDER,"You did lose the Blackfish after the Red Wedding. You had him right here in this hall and you let him leave. Then when I told you to hunt him down and kill him, you couldn’t find him. That’s what it means to lose something. Now he’s come back and taken Riverrun."
6979,4,5,WALDER,I don’t think it’s fair to blame us- -
6980,4,5,WALDER,"For 300 years we kissed Tully boots, swore oaths to them and their stinking fish banners. Not again. Riverrun is ours. Take it back."
6981,4,5,WALDER,We don’t have the men.
6982,4,5,WALDER,We’ve got 10 times as many men as the damn Blackfish.
6983,4,5,WALDER,The Mallisters have risen against us. And the Blackwoods.
6984,4,5,LOTHAR,"The Brotherhood Without Banners is rallying the commoners against us, raiding our supply trains and camps."
6985,4,5,WALDER,Riverrun can withstand a siege for a year. WALDER slaps his daughter on on the buttocks.
6986,4,5,WALDER,"If I want excuses, I’ll put her in charge. They’re laughing at us. All across the Riverlands right down to King’s Landing, they’re laughing at us. WALDER stands. Many family members stare at him."
6987,4,5,WALDER,"I hear it in my sleep! I’m not dead yet, unfortunately for you. And I’ll not leave this world until they all choke on that laughter. Take that castle back."
6988,4,5,LOTHAR,"He’ll never yield, Father."
6989,4,5,WALDER,"Oh, he’ll yield. WALDER nods at some servants at the rear of the hall. LOTHAR looks back at the servants. The servants exit. WALDER points first at LOTHAR and then at BLACK WALDER."
6990,4,5,WALDER,"You’ll show him the knife you used to kill Robb Stark’s child in his whore mother’s belly, and you’ll show him the knife you used to open his niece’s throat. And you’ll remind him who it was that got married at the Red Wedding in the first place. His nephew. WALDER pulls his daughter into his lap. The servants return, ushering in a man bound in chains. They undo his chains. The man is EDMURE TULLY. EDMURE stares at WALDER."
6991,4,5,WALDER,"Cheer up, Lord Edmure. You’re going home. INT. RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER JAIME and CERSEI are sitting in chairs across the room from each other."
6992,4,5,JAIME,I’m being sent to deal with the Blackfish. Apparently Walder Frey can’t manage it on his own because he’s 400 years old. Sent me with an army to the Riverlands and a siege that could last months. JAIME stands and paces.
6993,4,5,CERSEI,BEtter you’re elsewhere at the head of an army than in the sept dungeons.
6994,4,5,JAIME,I’m not going to the Riverlands. JAIME pours himself a cup of wine.
6995,4,5,CERSEI,"What, then?"
6996,4,5,JAIME,I’m going to give Bronn the largest bag of gold anyone’s ever seen and have him gather the best killers he knows. I’ll take them to the sept and I’ll remove the High Sparrow’s head and every other sparrow head I can find.
6997,4,5,CERSEI,You can’t.
6998,4,5,JAIME,He has our son! He stole our son! He’s torn our family apart. How should we treat people who tear us apart?
6999,4,5,CERSEI,"We should treat them without mercy and we will. But if you kill the High Sparrow, you won’t leave the sept alive. And without you, this is all for nothing. Stand at the head of our army where you belong, where Father wanted you. Show our men where their loyalties belong. Show them what lannisters are, what we do to our enemies. And take that stupid little castle back because it’s ours and because you can."
7000,4,5,JAIME,You’ll stand trial soon. I need to he here for you.
7001,4,5,CERSEI,"It will be a trial by combat. I have the Mountain. They’ve made us both stronger, all of them. CERSEI stands and approaches JAIME."
7002,4,5,CERSEI,They have no idea how strong we are. No idea what we’re going to do to them. JAIME and CERSEI embrace and kiss. CERSEI whispers into JAIME’s ear.
7003,4,5,CERSEI,"We’ve always been together. We’ll always be together. We’re the only two people in the world. They resume kissing. EXT. BEYOND THE WALL MEERA, BRAN, and the rider are gathered around a campfire. The rider beheads a rabbit and begins draining its blood. MEERA watches him."
7004,4,5,MEERA,Why did you help us? The rider looks at MEERA from behind his face mask.
7005,4,5,RIDER,The Three-Eyed Raven sent for me.
7006,4,5,MEERA,The Three-Eyed Raven’s dead.
7007,4,5,RIDER,"Now he lives again. BRAN startles as he comes out of a vision. MEERA goes to him. RIDER (to BRAN): When I last saw you, you were a boy. A fearless boy. Loved to climb the castle walls, frighten his mother."
7008,4,5,BRAN,Who are you? The rider removes his hood and face mask. He is BENJEN STARK. His skin is gray and he has blemishes on his face.
7009,4,5,BRAN,Uncle Benjen. The last letter Jon wrote me said you had been lost beyond the Wall.
7010,4,5,BENJEN,I led a ranging party deep into the North to find White Walkers. They found us. A white walker stabbed me in the gut with a sword of ice. Left me there to die. To turn. The Children found me. Stopped the walker’s magic from taking hold.
7011,4,5,BRAN,How?
7012,4,5,BENJEN,The same way they made the Walkers in the first place. You saw it yourself.
7013,4,5,BRAN,Dragonglass. A shard of dragonglass plunged into your heart.
7014,4,5,BENJEN,You are the Three-Eyed Raven now.
7015,4,5,BRAN,I didn’t have time to learn. I can’t control anything. BENJEN stands and walks over to BRAN and MEERA.
7016,4,5,BENJEN,You must learn to control it before the Night King comes. BENJEN kneels beside BRAN and offers him a cup.
7017,4,5,BENJEN,Drink. BRAN takes the cup and drinks.
7018,4,5,BENJEN,"One way or another, he will find his way to the world of men. When he does, you will be there waiting for him. And you will be ready. EXT. ESSOS ARID LANDS DAENERYS and DAARIO are leading the Dothraki horde on horseback. DAARIO shouts in Dothraki and raises his hand, halting the horde. DAENERYS stares at the face of a mountain crag in the distance."
7019,4,5,DAARIO,Everything all right?
7020,4,5,DAENERYS,How many days’ ride to Meereen?
7021,4,5,DAARIO,A week at best.
7022,4,5,DAENERYS,How many ships will I need to bring my khalasar to Westeros?
7023,4,5,DAARIO,"Dothraki and all their horses, the Unsullied, the Second Sons- - 1,000 ships easily. Probably more."
7024,4,5,DAENERYS,And who has that many?
7025,4,5,DAARIO,Nobody.
7026,4,5,DAENERYS,Nobody yet.
7027,4,5,DAARIO,So we ride for Meereen and after that we sail for Westeros. What then?
7028,4,5,DAENERYS,I take what is mine.
7029,4,5,DAARIO,You weren’t made to sit on a chair in a palance.
7030,4,5,DAENERYS,What was I made for?
7031,4,5,DAARIO,"You’re a conqueror, Daenerys Stormborn. The wind howls. DAENERYS stares beyond the mountain crag"
7032,4,5,DAENERYS,"Wait here. DAENERYS rides away from the horde and around the bend. Time passes. The Dothraki are growing antsy. DAARIO (speaking Dothraki): I’m going after her. Wait for me here. DAARIO starts off, but stops when a dragon’s roar erupts from the sky. The Dothraki look around. The shadow of a dragon appears on the mountainside. DROGON flies over the Dothraki horde with DAENERYS on its back. DROGON circles around and lands in front of the horde. He roars. DAENERYS (speaking Dothraki):  Every khal who ever lived chose three blood riders to fight beside him and guard his way. But I am not a khal. I will not choose three blood riders. I choose you all. The Dothraki cheer. DAENERYS (speaking Dothraki): I will ask more of you than any khal has ever asked of his khalassar! Will you ride the wooden horses across the black salt sea? The Dothraki cheer."
7033,4,5,DAENERYS,Will you kill my enemies in their iron suits and tear down their stone houses? The Dothraki cheer.
7034,4,5,DAENERYS,"Will you give me the Seven Kingdoms, the gift Khal Drogo promised me before the Mother of Mountains? The Dothraki cheer."
7035,4,5,DAENERYS,Are you with me? The Dothraki continue to cheer.
7036,4,6,DEFAULT,The Broken Man (Script) Lyrics EXT. RIVERLANDS - BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT Many men are performing various tasks pertaining to the construction of a church. Many women are preparing food.
7037,4,6,MAN,"That’s it. Get it to the top. MAN #2: Steady. Steady. BROTHER RAY is standing beneath the framing, addressing two men who are hoisting up a log."
7038,4,6,RAY,Up she goes. RAY turns to another man and slaps him on the back.
7039,4,6,RAY,"Hey, come on. Put your back into it, huh? RAY walks a few paces away, grabs an ax, and lifts it up to a man standing on the church framing."
7040,4,6,RAY,"Here you are, son. The man standing on the framing takes the ax. RAY turns to see two men carrying a log into the opening beneath the framing. He waves them in."
7041,4,6,RAY,"Oh, gentlemen, please. RAY walks out from beneath the framing and addresses more men carrying logs. RAY. And you lot, come on. Come on, get it moving. Come on, come on. RAY hurries beneath one of the logs and laughs. He turns and looks up at the church framing, smiles, and nods. In a field a little ways off, more men are carrying larger logs towards the church framing. Four men carry each log. A man carrying one of these heavy logs by himself comes into view. He drops the log in front of the church framing and pants, then turns to look out over the landscape. The man is SANDOR CLEGANE, The Hound. TITLE SEQUENCE EXT. RIVERLANDS - BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT OUTSKIRTS SANDOR repeatedly swings an ax into a horizontal log. Woods chips fly everywhere. RAY walks up behind SANDOR."
7042,4,6,RAY,In all my days I’ve never seen a man swing an ax like that. How many men did it take to cut you down?
7043,4,6,SANDOR,Just one.
7044,4,6,RAY,Ooh. he must have been some kind of monster. SANDOR sinks the ax into the log.
7045,4,6,SANDOR,He was a woman. RAY laughs. SANDOR continues chopping. RAY walks away.
7046,4,6,TO,"BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT A man standing beneath the church framing rings a bell. All of  the men rush down off the church framing and father at the food stations. The women divvy out food. RAY pours a cup of water and walks among the people. They are all sitting down on the ground and eating. SANDOR is sitting on a rock away from everyone else, eating. RAY approaches him from behind and hands him the cup of water. SANDOR takes it."
7047,4,6,RAY,I think some of the men are a bit afraid of you.
7048,4,6,SANDOR,I’m used to it. SANDOR drinks the entire cup of water.
7049,4,6,RAY,"When I found you, I thought you’d been dead for days. The way you were stinking already and you had bugs all over you and bone was coming through right there. RAY sits down next to SANDOR and points at SANDOR’s right knee."
7050,4,6,RAY,"I was gonna give you a proper burial and then you coughed. Oh, nearly shit myself. I reckoned you were gonna die by the time I loaded you on the wagon, but you didn’t. Now, I reckoned you’d die a dozen more times over the next few days, but you didn’t. What kept you going? SANDOR pauses and stares ahead."
7051,4,6,SANDOR,Hate. SANDOR continues eating.
7052,4,6,RAY,"No, there’s a reason you’re still here."
7053,4,6,SANDOR,"Aye, there’s a reason. I’m a big fucker and I’m tough to kill."
7054,4,6,RAY,"No, a reason. Gods aren’t done with you yet. SANDOR smiles. RAY stands and walks a few paces away from SANDOR, then turns to face him."
7055,4,6,SANDOR,"I’ve heard that before. Man was talking about a different god, though."
7056,4,6,RAY,"Well, maybe he was right. I don’t know much about the gods."
7057,4,6,SANDOR,You’re in the wrong line of work.
7058,4,6,RAY,"Oh, there’s plenty of pious sons of bitches who think they know the word of god or gods. I don’t. I don’t even know their real names. Maybe it is the Seven. Or maybe it’s the old gods. Or maybe it’s the Lord of Light. Or maybe they’re all the same fucking thing. I don’t know. What matters, I believe, is that there’s something greater than us. And whatever it is, it’s got plans for Sandor Clegane. SANDOR stops eating and stares up at RAY. RAY nods at him."
7059,4,6,SANDOR,You didn’t know me back in my time. You don’t know the things I’ve done.
7060,4,6,RAY,I’ve heard stories.
7061,4,6,SANDOR,If the gods are real...why haven’t they punished me?
7062,4,6,RAY,They have. RAY walks away. SANDOR stares out across the fields. INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOM MARGAERY is reading from the Book of the Seven. She is wearing a crown. The HIGH SPARROW enters.
7063,4,6,SPARROW,Your Grace. What are we reading today?
7064,4,6,MARGAERY,"The Book of the Mother, Your Holiness. Chapter three, verse 12."
7065,4,6,SPARROW,"Ah, “As water rounds the stones, smoothing- -”"
7066,4,6,MARGAERY,"“Smoothing what was jagged, so does a woman’s love calm a man’s brute nature. A wife salves her husband’s wounds, a mother sings her son to sleep.”"
7067,4,6,SPARROW,"You learn quickly. There are some who know every verse of the sacred text, but don’t have a drop of the Mother’s mercy in their blood and savages who can’t read at all who understand the Father’s wisdom."
7068,4,6,MARGAERY,"For year I pretended to love the poor, the afflicted. I had pity for them, but I never loved them. They disgusted me."
7069,4,6,SPARROW,They are hard to love. The HIGH SPARROW sits down on a bench.
7070,4,6,SPARROW,"The poor disgust us because they are us, shorn of our illusions. They show us what we’d look like without our fine clothes. How’d we smell without perfume. The HIGH SPARROW sighs."
7071,4,6,SPARROW,Can I ask you about a personal matter?
7072,4,6,MARGAERY,Of course. MARGAERY sits on the bench beside the HIGH SPARROW.
7073,4,6,SPARROW,"The king mentioned that since your reunion, you haven’t joined him in the marriage bed."
7074,4,6,MARGAERY,No.
7075,4,6,SPARROW,"You have a duty, Your Grace. To your husband, your king, your country, to the gods themselves."
7076,4,6,MARGAERY,It’s just...the desires that once drove me no longer do.
7077,4,6,SPARROW,"Congress does not require desire on the woman’s part, only patience. The king must have an heir if we are to continue our good work."
7078,4,6,MARGAERY,Forgive me. Sometimes the truth path is hard to find.
7079,4,6,SPARROW,Hard to find and harder still to walk upon. But you’ve made great progress. I only pray your grandmother follows your lead. The HIGH SPARROW stands.
7080,4,6,MARGAERY,My grandmother?
7081,4,6,SPARROW,"Yes. The Queen of Thorns is a remarkable woman, a strong woman, and an unrepentant sinner. You must teach her the new way as she taught you the old. Or I fear for her safety, body and soul."
7082,4,6,TO,"RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER MARGAERY and OLENNA are sitting at a table. SEPTA UNELLA stands several feet away, watching them."
7083,4,6,OLENNA,Does it move or talk? I want to speak with you alone.
7084,4,6,MARGAERY,Septa Unella has been my true friend and counselor. OLENNA stands.
7085,4,6,OLENNA,"Oh, this is madness! OLENNA takes MARGAERY’s hand and leads her out onto the balcony to a different table. SEPTA UNELLA follows them out. MARGAERY sits at the table. OLENNA (to SEPTA UNELLA): You’re not in your sanctuary now, my dear. All I have to do is whistle and my men will stroll in here and bash you about..."
7086,4,6,MARGAERY,Grandmother.
7087,4,6,OLENNA,...until I tell them to stop. If I tell them to stop. You could use a good bashing.
7088,4,6,MARGAERY,"Grandmother, please. OLENNA sits across from MARGAERY."
7089,4,6,OLENNA,What have they done to you?
7090,4,6,MARGAERY,"You marched against the High Sparrow, against the Faith."
7091,4,6,OLENNA,We marched for you.
7092,4,6,MARGAERY,"The gods could have punished you and Father, but they didn’t. They showed mercy."
7093,4,6,OLENNA,And what about your brother? What mercy did they show him?
7094,4,6,MARGAERY,"Loras’s only hope is to confess his crimes and repent. If he does, the Faith will allow him to return to Highgarden. He’ll have to renounce his name and title..."
7095,4,6,OLENNA,Have you lost your mind?
7096,4,6,MARGAERY,...and live his life as a penitent.
7097,4,6,OLENNA,"He is the heir to Highgarden, the future of House Tyrell."
7098,4,6,MARGAERY,He can begin again.
7099,4,6,OLENNA,As a mindless fanatic.
7100,4,6,MARGAERY,As a free man.
7101,4,6,OLENNA,You will leave for Highgarden today. There is no law that says you must stay here. MARGAERY stands.
7102,4,6,MARGAERY,I am the queen. It is my duty to serve my husband the king. MARGAERY walks around the table and kneels before OLENNA. Her back is to SEPTA UNELLA.
7103,4,6,MARGAERY,"But you should leave, Grandmother. Your place is at home."
7104,4,6,OLENNA,I will never leave you. Never.
7105,4,6,MARGAERY,You must. MARGAERY slips a piece of paper into OLENNA’s hand. MARGAERY’s eyes widen.
7106,4,6,MARGAERY,Go home. Find comfort in prayer and good works. MARGAERY stands.
7107,4,6,MARGAERY,The Mother watches over us all. OLENNA stands.
7108,4,6,OLENNA,"I’ll see you soon, my dear. MARGAERY and OLENNA embrace. MARGAERY closes her eyes and then steps back."
7109,4,6,MARGAERY,"Seven blessings to you, Grandmother. OLENNA nods and walks back into her chamber. MARGAERY stifles tears. She regains her composure and turns to face SEPTA UNELLA."
7110,4,6,MARGAERY,Shall we pray?
7111,4,6,TO,"RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER INNER BALCONY OLENNA walks out onto the balcony and shuts the door behind her. She looks around and then unfolds the piece of paper MARGAERY placed in her hand and looks at it. There is a drawing of a rose on it. OLENNA looks up and smiles. EXT. SOUTH OF THE WALL - WILDLING ENCAMPMENT JON SNOW, SANSA, DAVOS, TORMUND, and WUN WUN are meeting with DIM DALBA and the other Wildling leaders. They are all gathered around a fire pit."
7112,4,6,DALBA,"We said we’d fight with you, King Crow, when the time comes and we meant it, but this isn’t what we agreed to. These aren’t White Walkers. This isn’t an army of the dead. This isn’t our find."
7113,4,6,TORMUND,"If it weren’t for him, none of us would be here. All of you would be meat in the Night King’s army. And I’d be a pile of charred bones just like Mance."
7114,4,6,DALBA,"Remember Mance’s camp? It stretched all the way to the horizon. And look at us now. Look what’s left of us. And if we lose this, we’re gone. Dozens of tribes, hundreds of generations. Be like we were never there at all. We’ll be the last of the free folk."
7115,4,6,SNOW,"That’s what’ll happen to you if we lose. The Boltons, the Karstarks, the Umbers, they know you’re here. They know that more than half of you are women and children. After they finish with me, they’ll come for you. You’re right. This isn’t your fight. You shouldn’t have to come to Winterfell with me. I shouldn’t be asking you. It’s not the deal we made. I need you with me if we’re gonna beat them, and we need to beat them if you’re going to survive. TORMUND gestures to JON SNOW."
7116,4,6,TORMUND,"The crows killed him because he spoke for the free folk when no other southerners would. He died for us. If we are not willing to do the same for him, we’re cowards. And if that’s what we are, we deserve to be the last of the free folk. WUN WUN stands."
7117,4,6,WUN,Snow. WUN WUN walks away. DIM DALBA looks at the men around him. One of them nods. DIM DALBA walks up to JON SNOW and holds out his hand. JON takes it. DIM DALBA returns to his men. JON SNOW (to TORMUND): Are you sure they’ll come?
7118,4,6,TORMUND,"We’re not clever like you southerners. When we say we’ll do something, we do it. JON SNOW exhales. INT. RED KEEP - OLENNA’S CHAMBER OLENNA is sitting at a table, writing. CERSEI enters with GREGOR in tow."
7119,4,6,CERSEI,I heard you were leaving King’s Landing.
7120,4,6,OLENNA,That is hardly your concern.
7121,4,6,CERSEI,Your grandson is still a prisoner. You’ll leave him rotting in a cell?
7122,4,6,OLENNA,Loras rots in a cell because of you. THe High Sparrow rules this city because of you. Our two ancient houses face collapse because of you and your stupidity.
7123,4,6,CERSEI,You’re right. I made a terrible mistake. I carry it with me every single day.
7124,4,6,OLENNA,Good.
7125,4,6,CERSEI,I delivered an army of fanatics onto our doorstep. And now we must fight them together. We need each other.
7126,4,6,OLENNA,"I wonder if you’re the worst person I’ve ever met. At a certain age, it’s hard to recall. But the truly vile do stand out through the years. Do you remember the way you smirked at me when my grandson and granddaughter were dragged off to their cells? I do. I’ll never forget it."
7127,4,6,CERSEI,You love your granddaughter. I love my son. It’s the only truth I know. We must defend them.
7128,4,6,OLENNA,"I’m leaving this wretched city as fast as I can before that shoeless zealot throws me into one of his cells. If you’re half as bright as you think you are, you’ll find your way out of here, too."
7129,4,6,CERSEI,Never. I’ll never leave my son.
7130,4,6,OLENNA,"What’ll you do, then? You have no support. Not anymore. Your brother’s gone. The High Sparrow saw to that. The rest of your family have abandoned you. The people despise you. You’re surrounded by enemies, thousands of them. You’re going to kill them all by yourself? You’ve lost, Cersei. It’s the only joy I can find in all this misery. OLENNA goes back to writing. EXT. RIVERRUN - OUTSKIRTS A Lannister army approaches Riverrun led by JAIME and BRONN. JAIME and BRONN stop their horses on a hill and look out at the encampment of Freys at the foot of Riverrun."
7131,4,6,MAN,Pick the pace up. Keep going. MAN #2: Keep it moving!
7132,4,6,BRONN,"Now, that is a sorry attempt at a siege. Someone needs to teach those sad twats how to dig trenches."
7133,4,6,JAIME,Someone certainly does. JAIME looks at BRONN.
7134,4,6,BRONN,"Oh, no. Not me. I’m just an upjumped sellsword."
7135,4,6,JAIME,You’re an anointed knight. There’s quite a difference.
7136,4,6,BRONN,"Aye, knights don’t get paid."
7137,4,6,JAIME,You have better instincts than any officer in the Lannister army.
7138,4,6,BRONN,That’s like saying I have a bigger cock than anyone in the Unsullied army.
7139,4,6,JAIME,I expect to command all the Lannister forces before long. You can be the right hand I lost.
7140,4,6,BRONN,You promised me a lordship and a castle and a highborn beauty for a wife.
7141,4,6,JAIME,And you’ll get all three. A Lannister always- -
7142,4,6,BRONN,Don’t say it. Don’t fucking say it. BRONN ushers his horse onwards.
7143,4,6,TO,"RIVERRUN - FREY ENCAMPMENT JAIME and BRONN lead a group of Lannister soldiers through the encampment. Some Frey men gather around and stare at them. LOTHAR is standing at the foot of Riverrun, shouting up at the castle walls. BLACK WALDER is behind him, standing on a makeshift hangman’s platform. EDMURE is also on the platform with a noose around his neck. JAIME and BRONN watch them."
7144,4,6,LOTHAR,"Come out and fight us, Blackfish. Yield the castle or we’ll hang him. BRYNDEN TULLY, the Blackfish, walks along Riverrun’s castle wall and comes to a stop in front of an arrowslit. He stares out at LOTHAR, BLACK WALDER, and EDMURE."
7145,4,6,LOTHAR,This is your last warning. Yield the castle. LOTHAR looks back at BLACK WALDER. BLACK WALDER takes the noose off of EDMURE’s neck and draws a knife.
7146,4,6,WALDER,"You think I won’t do it, old man? BLACK WALDER holds the knife to EDMURE’s neck."
7147,4,6,WALDER,I sliced your niece’s throat from ear to ear. And where were you? Running and hiding like a fucking coward. Yield the castle or I cut his throat.
7148,4,6,BRYNDEN,"Go on, then. Cut his throat. BRYNDEN walks away. LOTHAR looks at BLACK WALDER and shrugs. BLACK WALDER takes the knife away from EDMURE’s neck. Some Frey men take EDMURE away. JAIME, BRONN, and the Lannister army advance towards LOTHAR and BLACK WALDER, and stop in front of them."
7149,4,6,JAIME,"Lothar, is it?"
7150,4,6,LOTHAR,Ser Jaime. We didn’t know you were coming.
7151,4,6,JAIME,"‘Cause you didn’t set up a proper perimeter. You just allowed 8,000 men to approach unchallenged."
7152,4,6,BRONN,Good thing we’re friends or we’d be fucking you in the ass right now.
7153,4,6,JAIME,Have Lord Edmure bathed and fed. BLACK WALDER waves at the Frey men escorting EDMURE.
7154,4,6,WALDER,"Whoa, whoa. The Frey men stop walking. BLACK WALDER approaches JAIME."
7155,4,6,LOTHAR,"Walder. LOTHAR puts his hand out to stop BLACK WALDER, but BLACK WALDER pushes him away. BLACK WALDER walks up to JAIME."
7156,4,6,WALDER,Edmure is a prisoner of House Frey. JAIME looks BLACK WALDER up and down.
7157,4,6,JAIME,"Only a fool makes threats he’s not prepared to carry out. Now let’s say I threatened to hit you unless you shut your mouth, but you kept talking. What do you think I’d do?"
7158,4,6,WALDER,I don’t give a rat’s- - JAIME hits BLACK WALDER across the face with his gold hand. BLACK WALDER staggers back beside LOTHAR.
7159,4,6,JAIME,I’m here by the king’s command to take back this castle. Have him bathed and fed. Unless you’d like to take his place.
7160,4,6,LOTHAR,"Apologies, Ser Jaime. LOTHAR waves at the Frey men escorting EDMURE."
7161,4,6,LOTHAR,Do as he says.
7162,4,6,JAIME,"The siege is now under my command. The next time the Blackfish looks out from those ramparts, he’ll see an army at his gates, not whatever this is."
7163,4,6,BRONN,Have your lads start digging perimeter trenches. Set pickets every hundred yards. And work double-time on those siege towers and trebuchets.
7164,4,6,WALDER,Those are our siege towers- -
7165,4,6,JAIME,"As I said, the siege is under my command. If that’s not to your liking, go home. LOTHAR and BLACK WALDER walk away. BRONN walks up behind JAIME."
7166,4,6,JAIME,Get word to the Blackfish. I want a parley.
7167,4,6,BRONN,A parley or a fight?
7168,4,6,JAIME,He’s an old man.
7169,4,6,BRONN,You’ve got one hand. My money’s on the old boy. EXT. BEAR ISLAND The castle of House Mormont sits atop a high hill. Waterfalls pour out below. A bird screeches.
7170,4,6,TO,"BEAR ISLAND - CASTLE AUDIENCE CHAMBER LYANNA MORMONT sits at a high table flanked by a commander and a maester. JON SNOW, SANSA, and DAVOS enter. Some guards close the doors behind them."
7171,4,6,SNOW,Lady Mormont.
7172,4,6,LYANNA,Welcome to Bear Island. JON SNOW looks at SANSA.
7173,4,6,SANSA,"I remember when you were born, my lady. You were named for my Aunt Lyanna. It was said she was a great beauty. I’m sure you will be, too."
7174,4,6,LYANNA,"I doubt it. My mother wasn’t a great beauty or any other kind of beauty. She was a great warrior, though. She died fighting for your brother, Robb."
7175,4,6,SNOW,"I served under your uncle at Castle Black, Lady Lyanna. He was also a great warrior and an honorable man. I was his steward. In fact- -"
7176,4,6,LYANNA,I think we’ve had enough small talk. What are you here?
7177,4,6,SNOW,Stannis Baratheon garrisoned at Castle Black before he marched on Winterfell and was killed. He showed me the letter you wrote to him when he petitioned for men. It said- -
7178,4,6,LYANNA,I remember what it said. “Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North whose name is Stark.”
7179,4,6,SNOW,"Robb is gone, but House Stark is not. And it needs your support now more than ever. I’ve come with my sister to ask for House Mormont’s allegiance. LYANNA leans towards her maester. They whisper to each other. LYANNA turns back to face JON SNOW."
7180,4,6,LYANNA,"As far as I understand, you’re a Snow and Lady Sansa is a Bolton. Or is she a Lannister? I’ve heard conflicting reports."
7181,4,6,SANSA,"I did what I had to do to survive, my lady. But I am a Stark. I will always be a Stark."
7182,4,6,LYANNA,"If you say so. In any case, you don’t just want my allegiance. You want my fighting men."
7183,4,6,SNOW,"Ramsay Bolton cannot be allowed to keep Winterfell, my lady. It is our duty to stop him. Even more so because he holds our brother Rickon Stark as prisoner. What you have to understand, my lady, is that- -"
7184,4,6,LYANNA,I understand that I’m responsible for Bear Island and all who live here. So why should I sacrifice one more Mormont life for someone else’s war? JON SNOW and SANSA fall silent. DAVOS steps forward.
7185,4,6,DAVOS,"If it please, my lady, I understand how you feel."
7186,4,6,LYANNA,"I don’t know you, Ser…?"
7187,4,6,DAVOS,"Davos, my lady, of House Seaworth. LYANNA turns to her maester."
7188,4,6,DAVOS,You needn’t ask your maester about my house. It’s rather new. LYANNA settles back into her chair.
7189,4,6,LYANNA,"All right, Ser Davos of House Seaworth. How is it you understand how I feel?"
7190,4,6,DAVOS,"You never thought you’d find yourself in your position. Being responsible for so many lives at such a young age. I never thought I’d be in my position. I was a crabber’s son, then I was a smuggler. And now I found myself addressing the lady of a great house in time of war. But I’m here because this isn’t someone else’s war. It’s our war."
7191,4,6,LYANNA,"Go on, Ser Davos."
7192,4,6,DAVOS,"Your uncle, Lord Commander Mormont, made that man his steward. He chose Jon to be his successor because he knew had the courage to do what was right, even if it meant giving his life. Because Jeor Mormont and Jon Snow both understood that the real war isn’t between a few squabbling houses. It’s between the living and the dead. And make no mistake, my lady, the dead are coming."
7193,4,6,LYANNA,Is this true? JON SNOW nods.
7194,4,6,SNOW,Your uncle fought them at the Fist of the First Men. I fought them at Hardhome. We both lost.
7195,4,6,DAVOS,"As long as the Boltons hold Winterfell, the North is divided. And a divided North won’t stand a chance against the Night King. You want to protect your people, my lady. I understand. But there’s no hiding from this. We have to fight and we need to do it together. LYANNA’s maester leans over to whisper in her ear, but she waves him away."
7196,4,6,LYANNA,"House Mormont has kept faith with House Stark for 1,000 years. We will not break faith today."
7197,4,6,SNOW,"Thank you, my lady. How many fighting men can we expect? LYANNA leans to her military commander and they whisper to each other."
7198,4,6,LYANNA,62.
7199,4,6,SNOW,62?
7200,4,6,LYANNA,"We are not a large house, but we’re a proud one. And every man from Bear Island fights with the strength of 10 mainlanders."
7201,4,6,DAVOS,"If they’re half as ferocious as their lady, the Boltons are doomed. LYANNA smiles and nods. EXT. RIVERRUN - LANNISTER ENCAMPMENT JAIME is on horseback, galloping through the encampment. He is accompanied by a bannerman and a regiment of foot soldiers. When he reaches the bridge leading to Riverrun’s castle, he dismounts his horse and walks across it. He stands at the foot of the bridge and stares down into the water. Above, several Tully soldiers notch their crossbows and point them at him through arrowslits. The drawbridge lowers. BRYNDEN stands on the other side, accompanied by a regiment of Tully soldiers. BRYNDEN walks out across the drawbridge alone and approaches JAIME."
7202,4,6,BRYNDEN,Kingslayer.
7203,4,6,JAIME,Blackfish.
7204,4,6,BRYNDEN,I assume you’re here to fulfill the vow you gave my niece. I don’t see Sansa and Arya.
7205,4,6,JAIME,I don’t have them.
7206,4,6,BRYNDEN,Pity. Do you wish to resume your captivity? JAIME shakes his head.
7207,4,6,BRYNDEN,Then why are you here?
7208,4,6,JAIME,"You know why I’m here. This castle belongs to House Frey. You’re trespassing. In the name of King Tommen, I order you to surrender or- -"
7209,4,6,BRYNDEN,Or you’ll kill Edmure? BRYNDEN walks past JAIME.
7210,4,6,BRYNDEN,My nephew’s marked for death no matter what. Hang him and be done with it.
7211,4,6,JAIME,It won’t stop with Edmure. You’ll force me to storm the castle. Hundreds will die.
7212,4,6,BRYNDEN,Hundreds of mine. Thousands of yours. If you can breach the walls. JAIME positions himself beside BRYNDEN.
7213,4,6,JAIME,"We’ll breach them and kill every last one of you. But if you surrender, I’ll spare the lives of your men. On my honor."
7214,4,6,BRYNDEN,Your honor? Bargaining with oathbreakers is like building on quicksand.
7215,4,6,JAIME,"The war is over, ser. Why sacrifice living men to a lost cause? BRYNDEN turns to face JAIME and walks close to him."
7216,4,6,BRYNDEN,"As long as I’m standing, the war is not over. This is my home. I was born in this castle and I’m ready to die in it. So you can either attack or try to starve us out. We have enough provisions for two years. Do you have two years, Kingslayer? BRYNDEN walks past JAIME and continues back across the drawbridge."
7217,4,6,JAIME,You clearly have no intention of saving your men’s lives. Why did you come to treat with me? BRYNDEN turns back to face JAIME.
7218,4,6,BRYNDEN,"Sieges are dull. And I wanted to see you in person, get the measure of you."
7219,4,6,JAIME,"Well, now you have."
7220,4,6,BRYNDEN,"Aye, now I have. I’m disappointed. BRYNDEN turns around and walks back inside the castle. The drawbridge begins to close. JAIME scrunches up his face, turns around, and walks back across the bridge. EXT. DEEPWOOD MOTTE - COURTYARD JON SNOW, SANSA, and DAVOS are meeting with ROBETT GLOVER. Several men serving under ROBETT stand in attendance."
7221,4,6,ROBETT,The answer is no.
7222,4,6,SNOW,"Lord Glover, if you could just hear us out."
7223,4,6,ROBETT,I’ve heard enough. We’ve only just taken back this castle from the Ironborn. The Boltons helped us do it. Now you want me to fight against them? I could be skinned for even talking to you.
7224,4,6,SNOW,The Boltons are traitors. Roose Bolton- -
7225,4,6,ROBETT,Have other northern houses pledged to fight for you?
7226,4,6,SNOW,House Mormont.
7227,4,6,ROBETT,And?
7228,4,6,SNOW,We sent raven to Houses Manderly- -
7229,4,6,ROBETT,I don’t care about ravens. You’re asking me to join your army. Who is fighting in this army?
7230,4,6,SNOW,The bulk of the force is made up of wildlings. ROBETT laughs.
7231,4,6,ROBETT,Then the rumors are true. I didn’t dare believe them. I received you out of respect for your father. Now I would like you to leave. House Glover will not abandon its ancestral home to fight alongside wildlings. ROBETT turns around and heads up the stairs towards a door attended by his men.
7232,4,6,SNOW,Lord Glover.
7233,4,6,ROBETT,There’s nothing else to say.
7234,4,6,SANSA,I would remind you that House Glover is pledged to House Stark. Sworn to answer when called upon. JON SNOW glares at SANSA. ROBETT turns on his heel and walks up close to SANSA.
7235,4,6,ROBETT,"Yes, my family served House Stark for centuries. We wept when we heard of your father’s death. When my brother was lord of this castle, he answered Robb’s call and hailed him King in the North. ROBETT gets closer to SANSA."
7236,4,6,ROBETT,And where was King Robb when the Ironborn attacked this castle? When they threw my wife and children in prison and brutalized and killed our subjects? Taking up with a foreign whore. Getting himself and those who followed him killed. ROBETT looks at JON SNOW and then back at SANSA.
7237,4,6,ROBETT,"I served House Stark once, but House Stark is dead. ROBETT turns, climbs the stairs to the door, and walks through it. SANSA and JON SNOW look down. EXT. LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAY Many boats bearing the sigil of House Greyjoy on their sails are docked in the bay near the Long Bridge. Chatter and laughter can be heard from the Long Bridge."
7238,4,6,TO,"LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAR Many Ironborn men are communing with prostitutes. THEON sits at a table alone, looking back at forth at them. YARA sits down at his table accompanied by a prostitute. She and the prostitute kiss at length. THEON does not look at them."
7239,4,6,THEON,Why did we have to come here?
7240,4,6,YARA,Some of us still like it. Have a drink at least.
7241,4,6,THEON,I don’t want one. YARA sighs and turns back to the prostitute..
7242,4,6,YARA,"Don’t go far, love. YARA kisses the prostitutes breast."
7243,4,6,YARA,I’ll find you in a bit. The prostitute stands. YARA kisses her backside and then slaps it. The prostitute giggles and runs away. YARA laughs and grabs a drink.
7244,4,6,YARA,Nothing on the Iron Islands has an ass like that. Doesn’t interest you anymore? THEON scrunches up his face.
7245,4,6,YARA,"I’m sorry. I won’t joke about it. I’ll never hurt you, little brother. Don’t you know that? YARA pours herself another drink."
7246,4,6,THEON,You think Uncle Euron’s hunting for us?
7247,4,6,YARA,"Of course he is. As long as we’re alive, we’re a threat."
7248,4,6,THEON,He’ll find us.
7249,4,6,YARA,It’s a great big world and we have fast ships. Drink.
7250,4,6,THEON,I don’t want any.
7251,4,6,YARA,I don’t care what you want. Drink. THEON takes a small sip of his drink.
7252,4,6,YARA,Drink it all. THEON drinks deeper.
7253,4,6,YARA,"You’re Ironborn, Theon. I know you’ve had some bad years."
7254,4,6,THEON,Some bad years?
7255,4,6,YARA,But I’m tired of watching you cower like a beat dog. Drink the goddamn ale. THEON takes another deep drink.
7256,4,6,YARA,"Now listen to me. I need you. The real Theon Greyjoy, not this rat shit pretender. Can you find him for me? Drink. THEON drinks more deeply.."
7257,4,6,YARA,"You escaped, do you hear me? You got away and you’re never going back. We’ll get justice for you."
7258,4,6,THEON,"If I got justice, my burnt body would hang over the gates of Winterfell."
7259,4,6,YARA,"Fuck justice, then. We’ll get revenge. Drink. THEON downs the rest of his ale. YARA moves closer to THEON."
7260,4,6,YARA,"Listen to me. If you’re so broken that there’s no coming back, take a knife and cut your wrists. End it. But if you’re staying, Theon, I need you. We’re gonna sail to Meereen. We’re gonna make a pact with this Dragon Queen. And we’re gonna take back the Iron Islands. YARA places her hand on the back of THEON’s neck."
7261,4,6,YARA,Are you with me? Are you really with me? THEON slowly raises his head up and locks eyes with YARA. He nods. YARA smiles and kisses his forehead.
7262,4,6,YARA,"Now, since it’s my last night ashore for a long while, I’m gonna go fuck the tits off this one. YARA stands, pats THEON on the back, walks over to the prostitute she was communing with earlier, and takes her hand. THEON stares blankly to the side. EXT. NORTHERN WILDERNESS - STARK ENCAMPMENT JON SNOW, SANSA, and DAVOS are riding horses through the encampment."
7263,4,6,DAVOS,Stannis camped here on his way to Winterfell.
7264,4,6,SANSA,And that’s a good thing?
7265,4,6,DAVOS,He was the most experienced commander in Westeros. He chose this place for a reason. Those mountains are a natural fortification. There’s a stream down there for the horses.
7266,4,6,SNOW,We’re not staying here long. Another storm could hit any day..
7267,4,6,DAVOS,"Aye, the snows defeated Stannis as much as the Boltons did."
7268,4,6,SNOW,We have to march on Winterfell now while we still can. They all dismount their horses and begin walking side by side.
7269,4,6,DAVOS,"2,000 Wildlings. 200 Hornwoods, 143 Mazins- -"
7270,4,6,SANSA,62 Mormonts.
7271,4,6,DAVOS,It’s not what we’d hoped for. But we still have a chance if we’re careful and smart. DAVOS spots two men fighting.
7272,4,6,DAVOS,For fuck’s sake. DAVOS hurries over to the men. JON SNOW and SANSA watch him go and then continue walking.
7273,4,6,SANSA,So he’s your most trusted advisor now? Because he secured 62 men from a ten year old?
7274,4,6,SNOW,Ser Davos is the reason I’m standing here talking to you and he served Stannis for years.
7275,4,6,SANSA,"Stannis who lost the Blackwater, who murdered his own brother, who doesn’t have a head? SANSA stops walking. JON keeps walking a few paces and then turns to face her."
7276,4,6,SANSA,It’s not enough. We need more men.
7277,4,6,SNOW,There’s no time.
7278,4,6,SANSA,"If we went down to Castle Cerwyn, I know that Lord- - JON SNOW moves close to SANSA."
7279,4,6,SNOW,"We fight with the army we have. JON SNOW looks over SANSA’s shoulder at DAVOS. He is standing in front of the fighting men, who are wrestling on the ground."
7280,4,6,DAVOS,"Friends, this is not worth fighting over! JON SNOW walks past SANSA and away."
7281,4,6,DAVOS,"This’ll be it, now. Right now, we don’t need to be fighting. One of the men gets in DAVOS’ face."
7282,4,6,MAN,Who the fuck are you?
7283,4,6,DAVOS,"Hold on. MAN #2: Yeah, who the fuck are you? SANSA spies the maester of Bear Island handling some crates containing ravens. He holds up one of the crates to LYANNA MORMONT."
7284,4,6,TO,"NORTHERN WILDERNESS - STARK ENCAMPMENT TENT SANSA is writing a letter. She signs her name, pours wax, and presses the wax with the direwolf sigil of House Stark. She picks up the letter and rereads it, then stares ahead. EXT. RIVERLANDS - BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT All of RAY’s followers are gathered together in a circle. RAY is standing in the center, speaking to them all. SANDOR stands at the far end of the flock, behind everyone else. The church framing stands on a hill in the background."
7285,4,6,RAY,"I was a soldier once. All my superiors thought I was brave. I wasn’t. I mean, I never ran from a fight. Only because I was afraid my friends would see I was afraid. That’s all I was, a coward. We followed orders no matter the orders. Burn that village. Fine, I’m your arsonist. Steal that farmer’s crops. Good, I’m your thief. Kill those young lads so they won’t take up arms against us. I’m your murderer. I remember once a woman screaming at us, calling us animals as we dragged her son from their hut. But we weren’t animals. Animals are true to their nature and we had betrayed ours. I cut that young boy’s throat myself as his mother screamed and my friends held her back. RAY sits down on a stump next to one of the men and rests his arm on the man’s shoulder."
7286,4,6,RAY,"That night...I felt such shame. Shame was so heavy on me, I couldn’t eat, I couldn’t sleep. SANDOR looks down."
7287,4,6,RAY,All I could do was stare into that dark sky and listen to that mother screaming her son’s name. I’ll hear her screaming the rest of my life. RAY stands and walks back to the center of the circle.
7288,4,6,RAY,"Now, I know I can never bring that lad back. All I can do with time I’ve got left is bring a little goodness into the world. That’s all any of us can do, isn’t it? Never too late to stop robbing people, to stop killing people. Start helping people. RAY stares at SANDOR."
7289,4,6,RAY,It’s never too late to come back. SANDOR returns RAY’s gaze but is distracted by three horsemen coming up the way. RAY turns to look at them. SANDOR walks a few paces into the midst of RAY’s followers and stares at the riders.
7290,4,6,RAY,"And it’s not about waiting for the gods to answer your prayers. It’s not even about the gods. It’s about you. Learning you have to answer your prayers yourself. The three riders reach the group and stop. RAY walks out to meet them. All of RAY’s followers stand. The riders are FLYNN, MORGAN, and LEM LEMONCLOAK."
7291,4,6,RAY,"Seven save you, friends. How can we help you?"
7292,4,6,LEM,What are you doing here?
7293,4,6,RAY,"Well, we’re talking about life. You?"
7294,4,6,LEM,Protecting the people.
7295,4,6,RAY,"Well, we thank you for your protection. Who are you protecting us from?"
7296,4,6,LEM,Do you have any horses?
7297,4,6,RAY,No horses. No gold. No steel.
7298,4,6,LEM,"Food, then. Protecting the people is hungry work."
7299,4,6,RAY,"I’m sure it is. You’re welcome to stay for supper, but we have hungry mouths here."
7300,4,6,LEM,Stay safe. The night is dark and full of terrors. LEM smiles. The three riders turn the horses around and ride off. SANDOR watches them leave.
7301,4,6,TO,RIVERLANDS - BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT OUTSKIRTS SANDOR is splitting wood with an ax on a chopping block. RAY walks up the path. SANDOR sees him coming but continues chopping.
7302,4,6,SANDOR,"“Seven save you, friends.”"
7303,4,6,RAY,I’m a fucking septon. What was I supposed to say?
7304,4,6,SANDOR,They don’t believe in your Seven. They’re from the Brotherhood. They follow the Red God.
7305,4,6,RAY,"Aye, well, all are welcome here. Anyway, we got nothing for them. SANDOR stops chopping."
7306,4,6,SANDOR,"Sure, you do. You’ve got food, you’ve got steel even if you say you don’t. And you’ve got women."
7307,4,6,RAY,What do you want to do? Fight them? Kill them? SANDOR shrugs and sighs.
7308,4,6,RAY,"It’d be you against all of them. I mean, these people don’t know how to fight."
7309,4,6,SANDOR,You do.
7310,4,6,RAY,I’m done with fighting.
7311,4,6,SANDOR,Even if it’s to protect yourself?
7312,4,6,RAY,Violence is a disease. You don’t cure a disease by spreading it to more people.
7313,4,6,SANDOR,"You don’t cure it by dying, either. SANDOR resumes chopping."
7314,4,6,RAY,You’ve done enough work for one day. Come on up for some supper. RAY starts back up the path.
7315,4,6,SANDOR,It’s gonna be a cold night. We’ll need firewood.
7316,4,6,RAY,I’ll save you a bowl of stew. Might even have some ale hidden away. EXT. BRAAVOS - MARKETPLACE People of all sorts line the streets. ARYA walks among them with her hands behind her back. She encounters two men sitting across from each other at a small table.
7317,4,6,MAN,He’s not a lying man. He says the Iron Fleet’s in Slaver’s Bay. I’m inclined to believe him. I’m not going anywhere near those mad fuckers. ARYA walks up beside the men and addressing the one who was speaking.
7318,4,6,ARYA,You’re Westerosi.
7319,4,6,MAN,What do you care?
7320,4,6,ARYA,I want to book passage home. The man laughs.
7321,4,6,MAN,You? Can’t afford it. ARYA tosses a bag of coins on the table in front of the man. The man opens it and pulls out some coins.
7322,4,6,MAN,Where’d you steal this from?
7323,4,6,ARYA,Why do you care?
7324,4,6,MAN,We leave in two days. You can have a hammock in steerage. ARYA throws another bag of coins on the table.
7325,4,6,ARYA,I want a cabin. And we’ll leave at dawn. ARYA walks past the man and grabs the coin purses off the table on the way.
7326,4,6,ARYA,See you at sunrise. ARYA walks onto a bridge and stops to stare out at the Titan. An old woman approaches her.
7327,4,6,WOMAN,"Sweet girl. ARYA turns to face the old woman. The old woman draws a blade and slashes ARYA across the stomach. She grabs ARYA by the neck and holds her tight to her body, the stabs ARYA severl times in the stomach and twists the blade. With her free hand, she reaches up and pulls off her face, revealing she is the WAIF in disguise. ARYA headbutss the WAIF, pushes her, and then runs and jumps off the opposite side of the bridge, plummeting into the water. The WAIF rushes to the side of the bridge ARYA jumped off and stares into the water. Bubbles and blood rise to the surface. The WAIF straightens her shirt and walks away."
7328,4,6,TO,"BRAAVOS - MARKETPLACE SHORE ARYA bursts through the surface of the water, gasping. She pulls herself up onto some steps , turns onto her back, and clutches her bleeding stomach."
7329,4,6,TO,"BRAAVOS - MARKETPLACE ARYA stumbles through the crowd, clutching her bleeding stomach and shivering. She looks from face to face. Everyone stares at her blankly. EXT. RIVERLANDS - BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT WOODS SANDOR is chopping a branch with a machete. He tosses the machete down and takes a drink of water, then hears people screaming and runs through the woods."
7330,4,7,DEFAULT,"No One (Script) Lyrics TITLE SEQUENCE EXT. SHEELBA SQUARE - STAGE LADY CRANE and CLARENZO are performing JOFFREY’s death scene in The Bloody Hand. Portraying CERSEI, LADY CRANE is kneeling, cradling CLARENZO’s head. The audience watches silently."
7331,4,7,CRANE,"My son. My firstborn son. My child king, hush. Listen to the gods, for you they sing. Fight no more, sweet child. Your wars are won. The wolves are buried and the false stag done. Shut your blue eyes, my love. Let the crown fall. The Father above beckons you into his hall. In Seventh Heaven I’ll see you once more. But now I seek vengeance on Sansa the whore and my brother the Imp who killed his own king. Born amongst lions, our curse from within. I will slay him, I swear. With noose or with knife, though it take me a fortnight, a moon, or my life. The crowd cheers. LADY CRANE and CLARENZO stand and bow. LADY CRANE makes her way backstage. She takes off her wig and sits down at her table in the actors’ break room, wiping her eyes. She takes her bottle of rum and begins to pour herself a glass but stops when she hears a rustling from behind a clothing rack. She stands and walks over to the clothing rack, then parts the clothes. ARYA is lying on the ground behind the rack, bleeding from her stomach."
7332,4,7,TO,"BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT ARYA is lying in bed. LADY CRANE sits beside her, treating her wounds."
7333,4,7,ARYA,You’re good at that. Where did you learn?
7334,4,7,CRANE,I’m a jealous woman. I’ve always liked bad men and they’ve always liked me. They’d come home wherever home was that night stinking of some whore’s perfume. LADY CRANE stands and carries her tray of medical supplies into the abutting room.
7335,4,7,CRANE,"So we’d fight and I’d put a hole in them. And then I’d feel terrible, so I’d patch them up. I got good at patching them up."
7336,4,7,ARYA,And good at putting holes in them. LADY CRANE chuckles. ARYA smiles.
7337,4,7,CRANE,And that.
7338,4,7,ARYA,What happened to the actress? The one who wanted you dead.
7339,4,7,CRANE,Bianca. LADY CRANE spoons soup into a bowl and carries it back to ARYA.
7340,4,7,CRANE,"She’ll have a hard time finding work as an actress after what I did to her face. LADY CRANE hands ARYA the bowl. ARYA takes it and slurps, then scrunches up her face."
7341,4,7,ARYA,Mmm.
7342,4,7,CRANE,I never did learn to cook. But eat. Eat. You need it. The company is moving on to Pentos soon. You should come with us.
7343,4,7,ARYA,I can’t.
7344,4,7,CRANE,"Why not? Got a feeling you’d be good at this sort of work. And besides, we need a new actress."
7345,4,7,ARYA,I don’t think I could remember all of the lines.
7346,4,7,CRANE,Come with us. What’s left for you here?
7347,4,7,ARYA,You wouldn’t be safe. Not while she’s looking for me.
7348,4,7,CRANE,Who?
7349,4,7,ARYA,She doesn’t have a name.
7350,4,7,CRANE,Where will you go?
7351,4,7,ARYA,Essos is east and Westeros is west. But what’s west of Westeros?
7352,4,7,CRANE,I don’t know.
7353,4,7,ARYA,Nobody does. That’s where all the maps stop.
7354,4,7,CRANE,"The edge of the world, maybe."
7355,4,7,ARYA,I’d like to see that. ARYA is afflicted with pain from her wound. LADY CRANE stands and pours a milky white liquid into a glass.
7356,4,7,ARYA,What’s that?
7357,4,7,CRANE,Milk of the poppy.
7358,4,7,ARYA,I don’t want any. LADY CRANE hands ARYA the glass.
7359,4,7,CRANE,"Sleep is the only way you’ll heal. Trust me, if my soup didn’t kill you, nothing will. ARYA takes the glass, stares into it, and then drinks it down. She lays back and LADY CRANE tucks her in. ARYA falls asleep. LADY CRANE touches her hand and dims the candlelight. EXT. RIVERLANDS - WOODS Four men are sitting around a small campfire, two young and two middle-aged. One of the middle-aged men is named GATINS."
7360,4,7,MAN,"Thing about Gatins, right, is he used to be pretty."
7361,4,7,GATINS,I was a famous kisser. You lads know how to kiss proper? The young men look at each other.
7362,4,7,MAN,Course we do.
7363,4,7,GATINS,"This is for masters, this technique. You’re not ready. YOUNG MAN #2: I’m ready."
7364,4,7,MAN,He says he’s ready.
7365,4,7,GATINS,All right. GATINS stands and walks over to YOUNG MAN #2. YOUNG MAN #2 stands.
7366,4,7,GATINS,"Now, pay attention. You put your left hand on the back of the lady’s head. GATINS puts his left hand on the back of YOUNG MAN #2’s head."
7367,4,7,GATINS,Your right hand holds the small of the lady’s back like so. GATINS puts his right hand on the small of YOUNG MAN #2’s back.
7368,4,7,GATINS,"Very romantic. Take your middle finger, yeah, and you jam it right up her bunghole. GATINS shoves his hand down the back of YOUNG MAN #2’s pants. YOUNG MAN #2 flails and pulls away. The other middle-aged man bursts out laughing. GATINS smells his finger."
7369,4,7,MAN,So fucking close!
7370,4,7,GATINS,"Ah, it smells like pussy to me."
7371,4,7,MAN,"Look at him. You get hard, boy? YOUNG MAN #2: Fuck you! Disgusting old twats. GATINS sits back down next to the fire. YOUNG MAN #2 remains standing, fixing his pants. SANDOR appears, carrying an ax. He is walking towards YOUNG MAN #2. YOUNG MAN #2 has his back turned to him. YOUNG MAN #2: Got off on that, did you, you old fuck? The other three men spot SANDOR coming. They stand. YOUNG MAN #2 turns around to see what’s coming. SANDOR growls and decapitates him. SANDOR approaches the second young man and drives his ax into his chest. The middle-aged man approaches SANDOR from behind with a sword. SANDOR spins around and slices his throat open. SANDOR lunges at GATINS and drives his axe into his groin, then rips it away. Blood spills out and GATINS falls to his knees, whimpering. SANDOR puts his hand on GATINS’ head, forcing him to look up."
7372,4,7,SANDOR,Where’s the other one? The one with the yellow cloak.
7373,4,7,GATINS,Fuck you!
7374,4,7,SANDOR,"Those are your last words, fuck you? Come on, you can do better."
7375,4,7,GATINS,Cunt!
7376,4,7,SANDOR,"You’re shit at dying, you know that? SANDOR raises the ax above his head, growls, and buries it into GATINS. EXT. MEEREEN - MARKETPLACE The courtyard is filled with people of all types. People are buying, selling, and renovating. In one area, a red priestess is preaching to a crowd. RED PRIESTESS (speaking Valyrian): From the fire she was reborn to remake the world. Daenerys is a gift from the Lord of Light to her children. If we are steadfast in our love for the Queen and her faithful advisors, no man will ever lock us in chains again. TYRION and VARYS enter, walking together through the courtyard. TYRION smiles."
7377,4,7,TYRION,I’d call that a successful gambit.
7378,4,7,VARYS,Would you?
7379,4,7,TYRION,Look around. The city has come back to life.
7380,4,7,VARYS,You made a pact with fanatics.
7381,4,7,TYRION,I did and it worked.
7382,4,7,VARYS,"If you shaved your beard with a straight razor, you’d say the razor worked. That doesn’t mean it won’t cut your throat."
7383,4,7,TYRION,Spoken like a man who has never had to shave. TYRION and VARYS stop walking and stare out through an archway at the harbor.
7384,4,7,TYRION,I’m going to miss you.
7385,4,7,VARYS,I know.
7386,4,7,TYRION,I hope you’re right about this expedition of yours.
7387,4,7,VARYS,"If I don’t return, you’ll know I was wrong. TYRION broods. VARYS looks at him."
7388,4,7,VARYS,We need friends in Westeros. And we need ships.
7389,4,7,TYRION,"Most of all, we need our queen."
7390,4,7,VARYS,She’ll come back. She has to. My heart’s been broken too many times already. VARYS pats TYRION on the shoulder.
7391,4,7,VARYS,I’ll walk the rest of the way myself. I can’t go off on a secret mission in the company of the most famous dwarf in the city. TYRION smiles. VARYS walks on.
7392,4,7,TYRION,Varys. VARYS turns back and looks at TYRION.
7393,4,7,TYRION,"The most famous dwarf in the world. VARYS smiles and nods, then walks out into the harbor. TYRION walks back through the courtyard. INT. RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER CERSEI is sitting at a table, drinking. There is a knock on the door. QYBURN enters. GREGOR is standing out in the hall."
7394,4,7,QYBURN,"Your Grace, several members of the Faith Militant have been permitted entry to the Red Keep."
7395,4,7,CERSEI,Have been permitted? That’s rather a tortured way of putting it.
7396,4,7,QYBURN,"They demand to see you, Your Grace."
7397,4,7,CERSEI,Who permitted them inside the Red Keep? QYBURN says nothing.
7398,4,7,CERSEI,The king is aware of their presence?
7399,4,7,QYBURN,"He is, Your Grace. He’s currently in his chambers at prayer. CERSEI stands and walks past QYBURN out into the hall. QYBURN bows to her as she passes, then follows her out with GREGOR in tow. At the bottom of the steps, LANCEL and a group of Faith Militant are waiting. CERSEI, QYBURN, and GREGOR approach them. One of the Faith Militant stares up at GREGOR."
7400,4,7,LANCEL,"Your Grace, His Holiness the High Septon wishes to speak with you at the Great Sept of Baelor."
7401,4,7,CERSEI,His Holiness the High Septon is welcome to see me here in the Red Keep.
7402,4,7,LANCEL,"Your Grace, this is not a request."
7403,4,7,CERSEI,"It is a request, Cousin Lancel. You are asking me for something, I’m refusing."
7404,4,7,LANCEL,The High Septon commands you. Are you sure you want to refuse him?
7405,4,7,CERSEI,He promised me I could stay in the Red Keep until my trial.
7406,4,7,LANCEL,He made no such promises. If you refuse to come of your own free will- -
7407,4,7,CERSEI,"Get out. LANCEL nods at the Faith Militant. Two of them advance with spikes clubs. GREGOR steps in front of CERSEI. LANCEL (to GREGOR): Move aside, ser. GREGOR silently stares out from behind his helmet. LANCEL (to CERSEI): Order your man to step aside or there will be violence."
7408,4,7,CERSEI,"I choose violence. One of the Faith Militant swings his club into GREGOR’s chestplate. GREGOR is unaffected. The club is stuck in the metal of the armor and the Faith Militant man struggles to wrench it free. He pulls it loose and reels back for another swing, but GREGOR takes him by the throat with one hand and lifts him up off the ground. LANCEL and the other Faith Militant regroup in the courtyard. The man in GREGOR’s grasp gasps and drops his club. GREGOR tosses him out into the courtyard, then follows him out. GREGOR kneels over the man, grabs him by the jaw, and rips his head off. LANCEL looks around at the other Faith Militant. CERSEI smiles."
7409,4,7,CERSEI,"Please tell His High Holiness he’s always welcome to visit. CERSEI, QYBURN, and GREGOR turn to walk back up the steps. EXT. RIVERRUN BRIENNE and PODRICK arrive on horseback. They stare out at the Lannister/Frey encampment from an overlooking hill."
7410,4,7,PODRICK,"Looks like a siege, my lady."
7411,4,7,BRIENNE,"You have a keen military mind, Pod. BRIENNE spots JAIME riding a white horse among his men."
7412,4,7,PODRICK,"My lady. My lady. Several Lannister soldiers ride towards BRIENNE and PODRICK, and then encircle them."
7413,4,7,MAN,Who goes there? State your business!
7414,4,7,BRIENNE,My name is Brienne of Tarth. Please inform Ser Jaime Lannister I’ve come to speak with him. Tell him I have his sword.
7415,4,7,TO,RIVERRUN - LANNISTER-FREY ENCAMPMENT PODRICK watches Lannister soldiers riding through the encampment. His is choked from behind by an unknown man who reveals himself to be BRONN.
7416,4,7,BRONN,"Getting a bit old to be a squire, aren’t we? BRONN releases PODRICK. PODRICK coughs. BRONN laughs and slaps PODRICK on the shoulder."
7417,4,7,BRONN,Podrick fucking Payne. I thought you’d be dead by now.
7418,4,7,PODRICK,Not yet. BRONN laughs and motions to a nearby tent.
7419,4,7,BRONN,Are they in there?
7420,4,7,PODRICK,Mm-hmm.
7421,4,7,BRONN,You think they’re fucking?
7422,4,7,PODRICK,What? No.
7423,4,7,BRONN,"Why not? I’d fuck her. You’d fuck her, wouldn’t you?"
7424,4,7,PODRICK,I’m her squire.
7425,4,7,BRONN,"Oh. Well, he’d fuck her, that’s for sure. And she’s fuck him, don’t you think? The way she looks at him. The way all women look at him is frankly irritating. I preferred working with the little brother on that account. Come on, you’re the one with the magic cock. BRONN grabs PODRICK’s crotch."
7426,4,7,BRONN,You must have shown it to her by now.
7427,4,7,PODRICK,She’s training me to fight.
7428,4,7,BRONN,Is she? Oh.
7429,4,7,PODRICK,"An hour in the morning, and hour at night. Every day."
7430,4,7,BRONN,Then how come an old cunt like me can still sneak up and murder you?
7431,4,7,PODRICK,"Well, that’s a different sort of fighting."
7432,4,7,BRONN,"Now, that’s the truth, isn’t it? You want to learn that sort of fighting? PODRICK smiles and nods."
7433,4,7,BRONN,"All right, let’s start with your footwork. BRONN stands across from PODRICK."
7434,4,7,BRONN,Show me your stance. PODRICK postures up.
7435,4,7,BRONN,"Now, listen to me, Pod. See how your feet are about a yard apart? PODRICK looks down at his feet. BRONN slaps him across the face."
7436,4,7,BRONN,"Lesson number one, assume everyone wants to hit you. ‘Cause they do, Pod. Everyone wants to hit a fucking squire. Do it again. Come on, don’t sulk."
7437,4,7,TO,JAIME’S TENT BRIENNE and JAIME stand across from each other.
7438,4,7,JAIME,I never thought you’d find her. I just assumed Sansa was dead.
7439,4,7,BRIENNE,Why would you assume that?
7440,4,7,JAIME,"In my experience, girls like her don’t live very long."
7441,4,7,BRIENNE,I don’t think you know many girls like her.
7442,4,7,JAIME,"Well, I’m proud of you. I am. You fulfilled your oath to Catelyn Stark against all odds. JAIME walks around the room and comes to a stop on BRIENNE’s other side. BRIENNE turns to face him."
7443,4,7,JAIME,"Of course my sister wants Sansa dead. The girl is still a suspect in Joffrey’s murder, so there is that complication. What the hell are you doing here?"
7444,4,7,BRIENNE,I’ve come for the Blackfish.
7445,4,7,JAIME,You’re welcome to have him.
7446,4,7,BRIENNE,Lady Sansa desires to take her ancestral seat back from the Boltons and assume her rightful position as Lady of Winterfell.
7447,4,7,JAIME,With what army does she plan on taking Winterfell?
7448,4,7,BRIENNE,The Tully army.
7449,4,7,JAIME,"They’re a bit occupied at the moment. I was sent here to reclaim Riverrun currently defended by the Tully rebels, so you can see the conundrum."
7450,4,7,BRIENNE,The Tullys are rebels because they’re fighting for their home?
7451,4,7,JAIME,Riverrun was granted to the Freys by royal decree.
7452,4,7,BRIENNE,As a reward for betraying Robb Stark and slaughtering his family.
7453,4,7,JAIME,Exactly. JAIME and BRIENNE stare at each other.
7454,4,7,JAIME,We shouldn’t argue about politics.
7455,4,7,BRIENNE,"You’re a knight, Ser Jaime. I know there is honor in you. I’ve seen it myself."
7456,4,7,JAIME,I’m a Lannister. Don’t ask me to betray my own house.
7457,4,7,BRIENNE,I do no such thing. Take Riverrun without bloodshed. Ride south with your mission complete and your army intact.
7458,4,7,JAIME,What do you propose?
7459,4,7,BRIENNE,Allow me to enter Riverrun under a flag of truce. Let me try to persuade the Blackfish to give up the castle.
7460,4,7,JAIME,Why would he abandon his ancestral home?
7461,4,7,BRIENNE,Because you’ll allow him to lead the Tully forces safely north.
7462,4,7,JAIME,Have you ever met the Blackfish?
7463,4,7,BRIENNE,No.
7464,4,7,JAIME,He’s even more stubborn than you are. BRIENNE looks down. JAIME walks back around the table to BRIENNE’s other side.
7465,4,7,JAIME,"All right. Try to talk some sense into the old goat. He won’t listen, but his men might. Not everybody wants to die for someone else’s home."
7466,4,7,BRIENNE,"I need your word. If I persuade him to abandon the castle, you’ll grant us safe passage north."
7467,4,7,JAIME,You have my word. You have until nightfall. BRIENNE nods and undoes her sword belt. She hands Oathkeeper to JAIME. JAIME sighs.
7468,4,7,BRIENNE,You gave it to me for a purpose. I’ve achieved that purpose.
7469,4,7,JAIME,"It’s yours. It will always be yours. BRIENNE stares into JAIME’s eyes, then ties Oathkeeper back on her waist and begins to walk out. JAIME follows her to the entrance of the tent. BRIENNE turns back."
7470,4,7,BRIENNE,"one last thing, Ser Jaime."
7471,4,7,JAIME,"Yes, Lady Brienne?"
7472,4,7,BRIENNE,"Should I fail to persuade the Blackfish to surrender, and if you attack the castle, honor compels me to fight for Sansa’s kin."
7473,4,7,JAIME,Of course it does.
7474,4,7,BRIENNE,To fight you.
7475,4,7,JAIME,Let’s hope it doesn’t come to that. BRIENNE and JAIME stare into each other’s eyes. BRIENNE exits. JAIME watches her go.
7476,4,7,TO,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL BRIENNE and PODRICK follow BRYNDEN holding a piece of parchment as he walks along the walls of Riverrun.
7477,4,7,BRYNDEN,I’ve said no three times already.
7478,4,7,BRIENNE,I have a signed letter from your niece Sansa Stark.
7479,4,7,BRYNDEN,I haven’t seen her since she was a child. I don’t know her signature. I don’t know you. And I will not surrender. BRYNDEN turns to one of his soldiers.
7480,4,7,BRYNDEN,Double the guards tonight. BRYNDEN looks out at the Lannister/Frey encampment. BRYNDEL The Kingslayer wants to try us. I can feel it. BRYNDEN turns on his heel and walks inside. BRIENNE and PODRICK follow him.
7481,4,7,BRIENNE,"As I have said, my name is- -"
7482,4,7,BRYNDEN,"Yes, Brienne of Tarth. I know your father. A good man."
7483,4,7,BRIENNE,He always spoke highly of you.
7484,4,7,BRYNDEN,"And if he were here now, I’d tell him the same I’m telling you. BRYNDEN makes his way down a set of steps."
7485,4,7,BRYNDEN,"If you think I’m abandoning my family’s seat on the Kingslayer’s word of honor, you’re a bloody fool."
7486,4,7,BRIENNE,Riverrun cannot stand against the Lannisters and the Freys.
7487,4,7,BRYNDEN,"We can stand longer than your one-handed friend thinks we can. BRYNDEN, BRIENNE, and PODRICK emerge into Riverrun’s main courtyard."
7488,4,7,BRIENNE,He’s not my friend.
7489,4,7,BRYNDEN,No? BRYNDEN stops and turns back to face BRIENNE.
7490,4,7,BRYNDEN,Who gave you permission to cross the siege line and enter the castle? Who gave you that sword with the gold lion on the pommel?
7491,4,7,BRIENNE,"Ser Jaime kept his word to your niece Catelyn Stark. He sent me to find Sansa, to help her as Catelyn wanted. He gave me this sword to protect her. That is what I have done and I will continue to do until the day I die. BRIENNE holds out the piece of parchment to BRYNDEN. BRYNDEN takes it, unfolds it, and reads its contents. He smiles and chuckles under his breath."
7492,4,7,BRYNDEN,She’s exactly like her mother. BRIENNE smiles. BRYNDEN turns back to face her.
7493,4,7,BRYNDEN,I don’t have enough men to help her take Winterfell.
7494,4,7,BRIENNE,You have more than she does.
7495,4,7,BRYNDEN,"She wants her home back. I understand that. But this is my home. And if Jaime Lannister wants it, he can bloody well take it the way everyone else does. BRYNDEN hands the letter back to BRIENNE. She takes it. BRYNDEN walks away. BRIENNE (to PODRICK): Find the maester. We need to get a raven north to Sansa."
7496,4,7,PODRICK,What should I write?
7497,4,7,BRIENNE,"Tell her I failed. INT. RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM A crowd of nobles fills the throne room. CERSEI enters, followed by QYBURN and GREGOR. The crowd stares at them and parts to let them pass. They approach the throne. TOMMEN, KEVAN, and MAESTER PYCELLE stand atop the steps to the throne. KEVAN walks down the steps and confronts CERSEI."
7498,4,7,CERSEI,There’s to be a royal announcement?
7499,4,7,KEVAN,There is.
7500,4,7,CERSEI,Why wasn’t I informed?
7501,4,7,KEVAN,There is to be a royal announcement in the throne room at this very moment. CERSEi starts up the steps but KEVAN blocks her with his arm.
7502,4,7,KEVAN,Where are you going?
7503,4,7,CERSEI,To stand by my son.
7504,4,7,KEVAN,"Your place is in the gallery with the other ladies of the court. CERSEI stares at TOMMEN. TOMMEN looks away. MAESTER PYCELLE whispers to him. CERSEI, QYBURN, and GREGOR move to one of the nearby balconies. TOMMEN sits on the Iron Throne and addresses the crowd."
7505,4,7,TOMMEN,"Lords and ladies, the Faith and the Crown are the two pillars that hold up this world. One collapses, so does the other. The Father judges us all. If you break his laws...you will be punished. After conferring with His Holiness the High Septon, we have determined that Loras Tyrell and Cersei lannister’s trial will be held in the Great Sept of Baelor on the first day of the Festival of the Mother. Members of the crowd murmur to one another."
7506,4,7,TOMMEN,"Furthermore, after much prayer and reflection, the Crown has decided that from this day forward, trial by combat will be forbidden throughout the Seven Kingdoms. The tradition is a brutish one, a scheme devised by corrupt rulers in order to avoid true judgment from the gods. Cersei Lannister and Loras Tyrell will stand trial before seven septons as it was in the earliest days of the Faith. Seven blessings to all."
7507,4,7,CROWD,"Seven blessings. TOMMEN stands and makes his way out of the hall, accompanied by the goldcloaks. CERSEI watches him leave. QYBURN walks up beside CERSEi and whispers to her."
7508,4,7,QYBURN,Your Grace...that old rumor you told me about. My little birds investigated.
7509,4,7,CERSEI,And? Was it just a rumor or something more?
7510,4,7,QYBURN,More. Much more. INT. MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM TYRION pours himself a glass of wine. GREY WORM and MISSANDEI sit across from him.
7511,4,7,MISSANDEI,You seem happy.
7512,4,7,TYRION,"I am happy. You should both be as well. Not so long ago, this city was ready to devour itself. TYRION puts down his glass of wine on a table and pours another glass of wine."
7513,4,7,TYRION,Now it’s like a man reborn.
7514,4,7,MISSANDEI,I will be happy when our queen returns.
7515,4,7,TYRION,Why don’t you drink? Why don’t either of you ever drink? TYRION pours a third glass of wine.
7516,4,7,WORM,Unsullied never drink.
7517,4,7,TYRION,Why not?
7518,4,7,WORM,Rules.
7519,4,7,TYRION,And who made these rules? Your former masters? GREY WORM and MISSANDEI look at each other.
7520,4,7,TYRION,Those miserable old shits didn’t want you to be human. Have a drink with me. TYRION hands GREY WORM one of the glasses of wine. GREY WORM takes it. TYRION (to MISSANDEI): And you? What’s your excuse? GREY WORM sniffs his glass of wine and scrunches up his face. TYRION hands MISSANDEI the second glass of wine. She takes it.
7521,4,7,MISSANDEI,I have tried wine before. It made me feel funny.
7522,4,7,TYRION,That’s how you know it’s working. TYRION returns to his glass of wine and raises it up.
7523,4,7,TYRION,Here’s to our queen. Anyone not drinking is disrespecting our queen. GREY WORM and MISSANDEI raise their glasses.
7524,4,7,TYRION,"To Daenerys Stormborn, Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains, long may she reign."
7525,4,7,MISSANDEI,Long may she reign. GREY WORM and MISSANDEI sip from their glasses. TYRION drinks all of his.
7526,4,7,TYRION,Do you like it?
7527,4,7,WORM,Tastes like it has turned. TYRION walks to another decanter on the opposite side of the room and pours himself another glass of wine.
7528,4,7,TYRION,"Yes, yes. Fermentation. One day, after our queen has taken the Seven Kingdoms...I’d like to have my own vineyard. Make my own wine. The Imp’s Delight. Only my close friends could drink it. TYRION sips his wine."
7529,4,7,TYRION,"Tell me a joke, Missandei of Naath. TYRION walks back in front of GREY WORM and MISSANDEI."
7530,4,7,MISSANDEI,I do not know any jokes.
7531,4,7,TYRION,Grey worm? GREY WORM stares and says nothing.
7532,4,7,TYRION,"Right. Three lords walk into a tavern- - a Stark, a Martell, and a Lannister. They order ale... MISSANDEI sips her wine."
7533,4,7,TYRION,"...but when the barkeep brings them over, each of them finds a fly in his cup. The Lannister, outraged, shoves the cup aside and demands another. The Martell plucks the fly out and swallows it whole. The Stark reaches into his cup, pulls out the fly and shouts, “Spit it out, you see shit. Spit it out.” GREY WORM and MISSANDEI do not laugh."
7534,4,7,TYRION,It’s funnier in Westeros.
7535,4,7,WORM,"The Starks and the lannisters, i thought these were enemies."
7536,4,7,TYRION,Yes.
7537,4,7,MISSANDEI,"A joke is like a story, Torgo Nudho. Not a true story, necessarily."
7538,4,7,TYRION,"A story that’s supposed to make you laugh, ideally. Not at the moment, perhaps. MISSANDEI sips her wine again."
7539,4,7,TYRION,"Missandei, do you like the wine?"
7540,4,7,MISSANDEI,I do.
7541,4,7,TYRION,Tell a joke.
7542,4,7,MISSANDEI,Two translators are on a sinking ship. TYRION smiles.
7543,4,7,MISSANDEI,"The first says, “Do you know how to swim?” The second says, “No, but I can shout for help in 19 languages.” There is a pause. TYRION Ah! TYRION begins to laugh. MISSANDEI smiles and sips her wine."
7544,4,7,WORM,That is the worst joke I ever heard.
7545,4,7,MISSANDEI,You don’t even know what a joke is.
7546,4,7,WORM,I am soldier all my life. You think I never hear joke?
7547,4,7,TYRION,You lied to us.
7548,4,7,WORM,I make joke. MISSANDEI and TYRION laugh. GREY WORM smiles.
7549,4,7,MISSANDEI,More jokes.
7550,4,7,TYRION,"I once walked into a brothel with a honeycomb and a jackass. The madam says- - Bells begin to ring. GREY WORM stands and runs out of the room, shouting in Valyrian."
7551,4,7,TO,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SHORELINE A fleet of white-sailed ships approaches Meereen. TYRION and MISSANDEI stare at at the ships.
7552,4,7,MISSANDEI,"The Masters have come for their property. EXT. RIVERRUN - LANNISTER/FREY ENCAMPMENT JAIME rides horseback through the encampment, approaches a tent, dismounts, and enters."
7553,4,7,JAIME,"Lord Edmure. EDMURE’s hands are behind his back, his wrists bound around a vertical pole in the center of the tent. He is kneeling."
7554,4,7,JAIME,I apologize for the way the Freys treated you. A man of your birth deserved better. You have my word you’ll be properly fed and clothes from now on. EDMURE stands.
7555,4,7,EDMURE,I have your word? EDMURE scoffs.
7556,4,7,EDMURE,"Oh, good. Good, that’s- - that’s a fine thing. My uncle will never surrender the castle, ser. Whatever game you’re playing."
7557,4,7,JAIME,"The Blackfish is an old man. A good death is all he can hope for. But you, you have a child now, I’ve heard. A son you sired on your wedding night. You’re a potent man."
7558,4,7,EDMURE,A son I’ve never met born of a wife that I haven’t seen since our first night together.
7559,4,7,JAIME,"You should be with them both. I can arrange that, you realize? Comfortable rooms for you at Casterly Rock. A tutor for your boy, knights to train him to fight and to ride. And when he comes of age, he’ll have a keep of his own."
7560,4,7,EDMURE,Do you imagine yourself a decent person? Is that it? After you’ve massacred my family. Kept me in a cell for years. Stolen our lands.
7561,4,7,JAIME,"I’ll remind you that our houses are at war. I’m sorry if this conflict has inconvenienced you, but rebelling against the Crown does have consequences."
7562,4,7,EDMURE,Says the man who shoved his sword through his king’s back.
7563,4,7,JAIME,Did I give you the impression that this was a negotiation? It’s not. JAIME sits on a barrel in the corner of the room.
7564,4,7,EDMURE,You understand. On some level you understand that you’re an evil man.
7565,4,7,JAIME,I’ll leave the judgments to the gods.
7566,4,7,EDMURE,"Well, that is convenient for you. You’re a fine-looking fellow, aren’t you? EDMURE chuckles."
7567,4,7,EDMURE,"Your square jaw, your golden armor. Tell me, I want to know. I truly do. How do you live with yourself? All of us have to believe that we’re decent, don’t we? You have to sleep at night. How do you tell yourself that you’re decent after everything that you’ve done?"
7568,4,7,JAIME,I was your sister’s prisoner once. She hit me on the head with a rock if I remember correctly. EDMURE laughs.
7569,4,7,EDMURE,Yeah. She should have killed you.
7570,4,7,JAIME,"Perhaps, but she didn’t. Catelyn Stark hated me just like you hate me. But I didn’t hate her. I admired her. Far more than her husband or her son."
7571,4,7,EDMURE,Do you think I care whom you admire and whom you don’t?
7572,4,7,JAIME,"No, I don’t, but I’m telling you anyway because you’re my prisoner. You don’t have a choice. The love she had for her children, I was a little awed by it. Reminded me of my sister."
7573,4,7,EDMURE,"Oh. Oh, I see. You’re a madman."
7574,4,7,JAIME,I’m not here to trade insults. Your sister was a strong- -
7575,4,7,EDMURE,Don’t talk about Cat!
7576,4,7,JAIME,I’ll talk about whomever I want. EDMURE grunts and struggles against his bindings.
7577,4,7,JAIME,"She loved her children. I suppose all mothers do, but Catelyn and Cersei, there’s a fierceness you don’t often see. JAIME stands and walks closer to EDMURE."
7578,4,7,JAIME,They’d do anything to protect their babies. JAIME gets in EDMURE’s face.
7579,4,7,JAIME,Start a war. Burn cities to ash. Free their worst enemies. The things we do for love.
7580,4,7,EDMURE,You didn’t come here to talk about our sisters.
7581,4,7,JAIME,"That’s exactly why I came here. I love Cersei. You can laugh at that if you want. You can sneer. It doesn’t matter. She needs me. And to get back to her, I have to take Riverrun. I’ll send for your baby boy. EDMURE struggles against his bindings, pushing himself towards JAIME."
7582,4,7,JAIME,"And I’ll launch him into Riverrun with a catapult. Because you don’t matter to me, Lord Edmure. Your son doesn’t matter to me. The people in the castle don’t matter to me. Only Cersei. And if I have to slaughter every Tully who ever lived to get back to her, that’s what I’ll do."
7583,4,7,TO,"RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL EDMURE crosses the bridge over Riverrun’s moat, carrying a torch. Several guards point crossbows down at him. He stops at the end of the bridge."
7584,4,7,CAPTAIN,Who goes there?
7585,4,7,EDMURE,"Edmure Tully, son of Hoster Tully, and the rightful Lord of Riverrun. I demand entry. BRYNDEN appears on the wall with the guards."
7586,4,7,BRYNDEN,Don’t let him in.
7587,4,7,CAPTAIN,He’s the Lord of Riverrun. I have to obey his commands.
7588,4,7,BRYNDEN,"He’s been their captive ever since they murdered his king at the Red Wedding. Why do you think the people who murdered his king at the Red Wedding would decide to let him come home? Because it’s a trap, you idiot. Don’t let him in. BRYNDEN turns to walk away."
7589,4,7,CAPTAIN,"He’s my lord, my lord. I’ve sworn to serve the Lord of Riverrun and obey his commands. BRYNDEN turns back."
7590,4,7,BRYNDEN,You’re not obeying Edmure’s commands. You’re obeying the fucking Kinglsayer’s commands. EDMURE (O.S.): I demand entry.
7591,4,7,CAPTAIN,My lord has given an order.
7592,4,7,BRYNDEN,WIth a knife to his throat. That is not a valid order. The guard captain turns to his fellow guards.
7593,4,7,CAPTAIN,Lower the drawbridge and open the gate for Lord Ed- - BRYNDEN unsheathes his sword halfway. The guard captain and the other guards show their steel.
7594,4,7,BRYNDEN,I’ll have your head before I surrender Riverrun.
7595,4,7,CAPTAIN,"You are not lord of this castle, my lord. BRYNDEN looks around at the other guards, sheathes his sword, and walks away."
7596,4,7,CAPTAIN,Lower the drawbridge!
7597,4,7,GUARD,"Aye, ser! The drawbridge begins to open. EDMURE stares back across the Lannister/Frey encampment. JAIME waits on his horse. BLACK WALDER rides up beside JAIME. The drawbridge fully extends. EDMURE walks inside. BLACK WALDER (to JAIME): If you’re wrong, we’re just surrendered our most valuable prisoner. The drawbridge closes behind EDMURE. Riverrun soldiers are gathered to meet him. BRYNDEN appears in the rear of their ranks. EDMURE spots BRYNDEN, hands his torch to one of the soldiers, and walks up the stairs to the top of the outer wall."
7598,4,7,CAPTAIN,"Welcome home, my lord."
7599,4,7,EDMURE,Command all the forces within the castle to lay down their arms. Open the gates.
7600,4,7,CAPTAIN,My lord- -
7601,4,7,EDMURE,Your lord has given a command. The drawbridge opens. JAIME glances at BLACK WALDER and rides towards Riverrun. The Lannister and Frey forces follow him into Riverrun.
7602,4,7,EDMURE,Find the Blackfish. Put him in irons and hand him over to the Freys. GUARD CAPTAIN (to a guard): Find him. The Riverrun soldiers lay down their arms in a pile as the Lannister forces enter the castle.
7603,4,7,TO,"RIVERRUN - RIVER EXIT BRYNDEN, PODRICK, and BRIENNE emerge from a doorway. BRYNDEN places the torch in a sconce and stands in the doorway. PODRICK gets onto a small rowboat floating on the surface of the river. BRIENNE kneels to steady the rowboat for PODRICK, then turns back to look at BRYNDEN."
7604,4,7,BRYNDEN,Go on. BRYNDEN stands and faces him.
7605,4,7,BRIENNE,Come with us.
7606,4,7,BRYNDEN,I’ve run before from the Red Wedding. I’m not running again. This is my family home.
7607,4,7,BRIENNE,Your family is in the North. Come with us. Don’t die for pride when you can fight for your blood.
7608,4,7,BRYNDEN,You’ll serve Sansa far better than I ever could. Some guards begin shouting in the background.
7609,4,7,BRYNDEN,"Go on, now. BRYNDEN unsheathes his sword."
7610,4,7,BRYNDEN,I haven’t had a proper sword fight in years. I expect I’ll make a damn fool of myself. BRYNDEN heads through the doorway and back up the steps. BRIENNE watches him leave and then gets on the rowboat.
7611,4,7,TO,RIVERRUN - COURTYARD Lannister and Frey banners are being draped all over the courtyard. Lannister soldiers walk over the fallen Tully banners.
7612,4,7,TO,RIVERRUN - OUTER WALL JAIME stands atop the outer wall. A Lannister guard enters and approaches him.
7613,4,7,GUARD,"We found the Blackfish, my lord."
7614,4,7,JAIME,Good. Bring him to me.
7615,4,7,GUARD,"He died fighting, my lord. JAIME nods to the guard. The guard exits. JAIME stares out at the river and sees BRIENNE and PODRICK rowing away from Riverrun. He looks around to see if anyone else is watching. BRIENNE looks over her shoulder and sees JAIME standing atop the wall. JAIME waves to her. BRIENNE waves back. EXT. MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SHORELINE The Masters’ fleet is launching flaming projectiles at Meereen and the Great Pyramid, setting them ablaze."
7616,4,7,TO,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM TYRION and MISSANDEI enter. GREY WORM is waiting for them. Many Unsullied stand guard around the room.
7617,4,7,TYRION,I was wrong. I admit it.
7618,4,7,MISSANDEI,That changes nothing.
7619,4,7,TYRION,The Unsullied could mount a defense off the beachhead. If the slavers’ forces- -
7620,4,7,WORM,No more talking from you. Your talking gave us this.
7621,4,7,TYRION,And I have acknowledged that. I’m trying- -
7622,4,7,WORM,You’re trying to tell me what the army should do. You do not know what the army should do.
7623,4,7,TYRION,"All right, what should the army do?"
7624,4,7,WORM,"We’ll not go to the beach. If we go to the beach, the Masters will take the pyramid. The pyramid is the only place in the city we can defend. We stay here."
7625,4,7,TYRION,And then?
7626,4,7,WORM,"We wait for them to come to us. Then we fight them. Something thuds and rattles the roof of the pyramid. Footsteps can be heard. Everyone looks up. MISSANDEI grabs a knife from a table and stands beside TYRION. GREY WORM and the Unsullied form up in front of the door to the balcony. One Unsullied opens the door. Another inches out through it, shield and spear in hand. The Unsullied man looks side to side and sees nothing, but then sees something and kneels. The rest of the Unsullied follow suit. DAENERYS enters. A dragon screeches and flies away in the background. EXT. RIVERLANDS - WOODS SANDOR walks along the center of a path through the woods, carrying an ax and a satchel. He hears horses whinnying and the voices of men. He follows the sounds and happens upon BERIC DONDARRION, THOROS OF MYR, and other members of the Brotherhood Without Banners. They are preparing to hang LEM and two of his accomplices, who stand on blocks ith nooses tied around their necks. BERIC turns to see SANDOR. Some of the Brotherhood members brandish weapons."
7627,4,7,BERIC,Clegane.
7628,4,7,THOROS,What the fuck you doing here?
7629,4,7,SANDOR,Chasing them. You?
7630,4,7,THOROS,Hanging them.
7631,4,7,SANDOR,Any particular reason?
7632,4,7,BERIC,They’re our men. Or they were. They attacked a nearby sept and murdered the villagers. Why do you want them?
7633,4,7,SANDOR,Same reason. I was helping build it. They killed a friend of mine.
7634,4,7,THOROS,You’ve got friends?
7635,4,7,SANDOR,Not anymore. They’re mine. SANDOR advances. BERIC and another member of the Brotherhood block his path.
7636,4,7,BERIC,It’s the Brotherhood’s good name they’ve dragged through the dirt.
7637,4,7,SANDOR,"Fuck your name. They’re mine. I killed you once before, Dondarrion. Happy to do it again. One of the Brotherhood members notches an arrow and points his bow at SANDOR."
7638,4,7,SANDOR,"Drop that arrow, you bloody girl. SANDOR points his ax at the man but keeps his eyes locked on BERIC."
7639,4,7,SANDOR,Tougher girls than you have tried to kill me. SANDOR walks towards the bowman.
7640,4,7,BERIC,"You can have one of them. SANDOR turns back to face BERIC, glances at the men about to be hanged, then looks back at BERIC."
7641,4,7,SANDOR,Two. BERIC looks at THOROS. THOROS nods. BERIC nods to SANDOR. SANDOR approaches one of the men and raises his ax above his head to swing. THOROS catches the ax’s handle from behind.
7642,4,7,THOROS,"No, no, no. SANDOR turns to face THOROS and tries to wrench his ax free."
7643,4,7,THOROS,We’re not butchers. We hang them. THOROS releases SANDOR’s ax.
7644,4,7,SANDOR,hanging? All over in an instant. Where’s the punishment in that?
7645,4,7,THOROS,They die.
7646,4,7,SANDOR,We all bloody die. SANDOR gestures to BERIC.
7647,4,7,SANDOR,Except this one here. I’ll only gut one of them.
7648,4,7,BERIC,No.
7649,4,7,SANDOR,I’ll chop off one hand.
7650,4,7,BERIC,We gave you two of the three out of respect for your loss. That’s generous.
7651,4,7,SANDOR,Bunch of nancies. SANDOR throws down his ax.
7652,4,7,SANDOR,There was a time I would have killed all seven of you just to gut these three.
7653,4,7,THOROS,"You’re getting old, Clegane."
7654,4,7,SANDOR,"He’s not. SANDOR kicks the box out from underneath one of the men, hanging him. He moves in front of LEM."
7655,4,7,LEM,"Please don’t. I’ll give you anything. SANDOR kicks the box out from underneath LEM, hanging him. LEM gasps for air. BERIC hangs the third man. SANDOR pulls the boot off of LEM’s foot. BERIC and THOROS begin to walk away, but turn back to look at SANDOR. SANDOR takes off his own boot and sizes up LEM’s boot to his own foot. He shoves his foot into LEM’s boot and looks up at BERIC and THOROS."
7656,4,7,SANDOR,Got anything to eat?
7657,4,7,TO,"RIVERLANDS - BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS’ ENCAMPMENT Several members of the Brotherhood are sitting around small campfires. SANDOR, BERIC, and some other Brothers are sitting at one such campfire. SANDOR is eating a piece of meat. THOROS approaches and sits beside them. THOROS (to SANDOR): Enjoying yourself?"
7658,4,7,SANDOR,I prefer chicken. THOROS hands SANDOR a water skin. SANDOR drinks from it.
7659,4,7,BERIC,You ought to join us. We could use you.
7660,4,7,SANDOR,I tried joining. Didn’t work out for me.
7661,4,7,THOROS,"Clegane, we’re here for a reason. The Lord of Light is keeping Beric alive for a reason. He gave a failed, drunk priest the power to bring him back for a reason. We are part of something larger than ourselves."
7662,4,7,SANDOR,"Lots of horrible shit in this world gets done for something larger than ourselves. SANDOR returns the water skin to THOROS, stands, walks to the river, and urinates into it."
7663,4,7,BERIC,Cold winds are rising in the North.
7664,4,7,SANDOR,And you’re going to go stop them?
7665,4,7,BERIC,We need good men to help us.
7666,4,7,SANDOR,"Last time you saw me, you wanted to execute me."
7667,4,7,BERIC,True enough. But the Lord of Light gave you the power to defeat me. Why? SANDOR laughs.
7668,4,7,SANDOR,"I beat you because I’m better than you, Beric. I was better than you before you started yammering on about the Lord and I’m better than you now. SANDOR returns to his spot by the campfire and sits."
7669,4,7,BERIC,"Aye, you’re probably right. You’re a fighter. You were born a fighter. You walked away from the fight. How did that go? Good and bad, young and old, the things we’re fighting will destroy them all alike. You can still help a lot more than you’ve harmed Clegane, it’s not too late for you. INT. BRAAVOS - LADY CRANE’S APARTMENT ARYA is sleeping. LADY CRANE enters the bedroom, sits down beside ARYA, and strokes her face. ARYA stirs and groans. LADY CRANE stands and walks back into the abutting room. She retrieves a stool and stands atop it, reaching for a bottle on top of a bureau. She turns around and sees a young man with blonde hair. Cut to ARYA’s perspective. There is a thud. ARYA awakens with a gasp and looks around. She sees a shadow moving in the abutting room."
7670,4,7,ARYA,Lady Crane? ARYA gets out of bed and winces. She walks towards the abutting room.
7671,4,7,ARYA,"Lady Crane? ARYA enters the abutting room and sees LADY CRANE lying crumpled on top of the stool, dead. Blood is pooled on the ground beneath her."
7672,4,7,WAIF,"If you’d have done your job, she would have died painlessly. ARYA turns to see the WAIF standing in the doorway with a knife. The WAIF approaches ARYA slowly and ARYA backs away, matching her pace."
7673,4,7,WAIF,Instead… The WAIF holds out her arms.
7674,4,7,WAIF,"The Many-Faced God was promised a name. He must always receive what is his. You can’t change that. I can’t change that. No one can. And now he’s been promised another name. ARYA turns around, runs out onto the balcony, and jumps off. She grunts as her hands and feet connect with the ground. The sprints off through the streets, pushing people out of the way. The WAIF emerges from the door to LADY CRANE’s apartment, spies ARYA, and chases after her. ARYA runs through an alleyway. A man pushes a cart in her way. She slides underneath it and continues running. The WAIF jumps clean over the cart. ARYA turns a corner and runs down a set of stairs. A woman dumps a barrel of water on the ground outside the door to a room at the bottom of the steps. ARYA sees her and darts into the room. The WAIF turns the corner to the steps but stops when she does not see ARYA. The room ARYA has entered is a sauna. She moves through it. A number of men in towels are relaxing in the heat. ARYA emerges from the door on the opposite side of the sauna and looks around. She enters the crowd, walking through it. The WAIF appears on a high wall behind her, then jumps down into the crowd. ARYA turns back to see her and runs away. The WAIF pursues her. ARYA reaches the end of the marketplace and jumps off a high wall. She lands on a large set of steps where many fruit merchants have laid their baskets. She tumbles down the steps, knocking over the baskets as she goes and grunting with pain. The crowd clamors. ARYA comes to a stop at the bottom of the steps. She puts her hand to her stomach. Her hand comes away bloody. The WAIF appears at the top of the steps. ARYA sees her, stands, and throws herself over a small wall into an alleyway. The WAIF follows her. ARYA whimpers as she moves through the alleyway. She leaves blood stains on everything she touches. She enters a small, dark room, lit by a single candle. The WAIF follows her inside, knife in hand. ARYA kneels in the small living space she has made for herself. The WAIF enters and shuts the door behind her."
7675,4,7,WAIF,It will all be over soon. On your knees or on your feet? ARYA retrieves Needle from beneath a blanket and stands.
7676,4,7,WAIF,"Haven’t we been through this already? That won’t help you. The WAIF advances. ARYA holds Needle up in front of her face, closes her eyes, and cuts the candle in half. The room goes dark."
7677,4,7,TO,BRAAVOS - HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE JAQEN enters the main hall. He notices a blood trail on the floor leading to the Hall of Faces. He follows the trail and enters the Hall. The trail leads to one of the columns bearing the faces. The WAIF’s bloody face rests in one of the sconces.
7678,4,7,ARYA,"You told her to kill me. ARYA appears behind JAQEN, pointing Needle at him. JAQEN turns to face her."
7679,4,7,JAQEN,Yes. But here you are. And there she is. JAQEN pushes his chest against Needle’s point.
7680,4,7,JAQEN,Finally a girl is no one.
7681,4,8,DEFAULT,"Battle of the Bastards (Script) Lyrics TITLE SEQUENCE EXT. MEEREEN - HARBOR The Masters’ men are launching flaming projectiles at the Great Pyramid and surrounding city from their ships. DAENERYS watches from atop a balcony of the Great Pyramid. She returns to the interior, to the conference room where TYRION awaits. DAENERYS approaches him. An explosion occurs outside."
7682,4,8,TYRION,"Despite appearances, I think you’ll find the city’s on the rise. An explosion occurs outside."
7683,4,8,TYRION,Perhaps we should take shelter. An explosion occurs outside.
7684,4,8,DAENERYS,The city is on the rise?
7685,4,8,TYRION,Meereen is strong. Commerce has returned to the markets. The people are behind you. An explosion occurs outside.
7686,4,8,TYRION,"Well, not all the people, of course. No ruler that ever lived had the support of all the people. But the rebirth of Meereen is the cause of this violence. The Masters cannot let Meereen succeed. Because if Meereen succeeds, a city without slavery, a city without Masters… An explosion occurs outside."
7687,4,8,TYRION,...it proves that no one needs a Master.
7688,4,8,DAENERYS,Good. Shall we begin?
7689,4,8,TYRION,Do we have a plan?
7690,4,8,DAENERYS,"I will crucify the Masters. I will set their fleets afire, kill every last one of their soldiers, and return their cities to the dirt. That is my plan. TYRION tightens his jaw and looks away."
7691,4,8,DAENERYS,You don’t approve?
7692,4,8,TYRION,You once told me you knew what your father was. Did you know his plans for King’s Landing when the Lannister armies were at his gates? An explosion occurs outside.
7693,4,8,TYRION,"Probably not. Well, he told my brother and Jaime told me. He had caches of wildfire hidden under the Red Keep, the Guildhalls, the Sept of Baelor, all the major thoroughfares. He would have burned every one of his citizens. The loyal ones and the trators. Every man, woman, and child. That’s why Jaime killed him."
7694,4,8,DAENERYS,This is entirely different.
7695,4,8,TYRION,"You’re talking about destroying cities. It’s not entirely different. I’d like to suggest an alternate approach. A blast causes the window across the room to explode inward, sending shards of wood flying everywhere. DAENERYS and TYRION duck, then turn to look at the window."
7696,4,8,TO,"MEEREEN - PLATEAU DAENERYS, TYRION, GREY WORM, MISSANDEI, and an assembly of Unsullied stand across from the three Masters, YEZZAN ZO QAGGAZ, RAZDAL MO ERAZ, and BELICHO PAENYMION, and a group of their soldiers. RAZDAL (to DAENERYS): Once before, I offered you peace. If you had not been so arrogant, you could have returned to your homeland with a fleet of ships. Instead, you will flee Slaver’s Bay on foot like the beggar queen you are."
7697,4,8,TYRION,"We are here to discuss terms of surrender, not to trade insults."
7698,4,8,YEZZAN,The terms are simple. You and your foreign friends will abandon the Great Pyramid and the city of Meereen. The Unsullied you stole from Kraznys mo Nakloz will remain to be sold again to the highest bidder. The translator you stole from Kraznys mo Nakloz will remain to be sold again to the highest bidder. The dragons beneath the Great Pyramid will be slaughtered.
7699,4,8,DAENERYS,"We obviously didn’t communicate clearly. We’re here to discuss your surrender, not mine."
7700,4,8,RAZDAL,I imagine it’s difficult adjust to the new reality. Your reign is over.
7701,4,8,DAENERYS,"My reign has just begun. A dragon screeches in the distance. YEZZAN turns to look in the direction of the screech. DROGON flies up over the plateau and lands on an overlooking structure. He roars and drops down beside DAENERYS. DAENERYS climbs on his back and they fly off over Meereen. When they pass over the entrance to the catacombs, RHAEGAL and VISERION bust down the door with flame and take flight to join them. The ensemble flies over the beach entrance to Meereen."
7702,4,8,TO,"MEEREEN - BEACH ENTRANCE A group of the Sons of the Harpy are slaughtering citizens of Meereen. Galloping footsteps can be heard in the distance. One of the Sons of the Harpy turns to look in the direction of the sound. The Dothraki horde led by DAARIO rounds the bend of a nearby cliff, yelling war cries and charging full force towards the Sons of the Harpy on horseback. DAARIO beheads a Son of the Harpy."
7703,4,8,TO,MEEREEN - HARBOR DAENERYS and the dragons fly over the Masters’ ships. The soldiers on the ships stop what they’re doing and stare up at the dragons. DAENERYS and DROGON come to a halt and hover in front of one of the ships.
7704,4,8,DAENERYS,Dracarys. The dragons shoot stream of fire down at the the ship. The ship becomes engulfed in flame and the soldiers scream as they die. The ship incinerates and capsizes.
7705,4,8,TO,MEEREEN - PLATEAU GREY WORM steps forward and addresses the Masters’ soldiers. GREY WORM (speaking Valyrian): You men have a choice: The Unsullied ready their spears. The Masters’ soldiers ready their swords.
7706,4,8,WORM,"...fight and die for the masters who would never fight and die for you, or go home to your families. A dragon screeches in the distance. The Masters’ soldiers lay down their arms and run away."
7707,4,8,TYRION,"Thank you for the armada. Our queen does love ships. Now, last time we spoke, we made a pact. You violated that pact. You declared war upon us. Though our queen does have a forgiving nature, this cannot be forgiven."
7708,4,8,MISSANDEI,Our queen insists that one of you must die as punishment for your crimes.
7709,4,8,TYRION,"It always seems a bit abstract, doesn’t it, other people dying? RAZDAL grabs YEZZAN."
7710,4,8,RAZDAL,Him. He should die.
7711,4,8,BELICHO,"Yes, him. TYRION looks at GREY WORM."
7712,4,8,RAZDAL,"He’s not one of us. He’s an outsider, a lowborn. He does not speak for us. GREY WORM approaches the YEZZAN and stares in his eyes."
7713,4,8,YEZZAN,Please. YEZZAN falls to his knees. GREY WORM unsheathes his dagger and slices RAZDAL and BELICHO’s throats. He sheathes his dagger and steps back. TYRION approaches YEZZAN and puts his hand on his shoulder.
7714,4,8,TYRION,"Tell your people what happened here. Tell them you live by the grace of Her Majesty. When they come forward with notions of retribution or ideas about returning the slave cities to their former glory, remind the what happened when Daenerys Stormborn and her dragons came to Meereen. TYRION pats YEZZAN on the shoulder. He, GREY WORM, and MISSANDEI walk away. EXT. WINTERFELL - OUTSKIRTS JON SNOW, SANSA, DAVOS, TORMUND, LYANNA MORMONT, and some Stark bannermen sit on horseback, waiting. RAMSAY, HARALD KARSTARK, SMALLJON UMBER, and a group of Bolton soldiers approach on horseback. They come to a halt in front of JON SNOW and compnay."
7715,4,8,SNOW,You don’t have to be here.
7716,4,8,SANSA,"Yes, I do."
7717,4,8,RAMSAY,My beloved wife. I’ve missed you terribly. RAMSAY looks at JON SNOW.
7718,4,8,RAMSAY,"Thank you for returning Lady Bolton safely. Now, dismount and kneel before me, surrender your army and proclaim me the true Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North. I will pardon you for deserting the Night’s Watch. I will pardon these treasonous lords for betraying my house. Come, bastard, you don’t have the men, you don’t have the horses, and you don’t have Winterfell. Why lead those pour souls into slaughter? There’s no need for a battle. Get off your hose and kneel. I’m a man of mercy."
7719,4,8,SNOW,You’re right. There’s no need for a battle. Thousands of men don’t need to die. Only one of us. Let’s end this the old way. You against me. RAMSAY chuckles.
7720,4,8,RAMSAY,"I keep hearing stories about you, bastard. The way people in the North talk about you, you’re the greatest swordsman who ever walked. Maybe you are that good. Maybe not. I don’t know if I’d beat you. But I know that my army will beat yours. I have 6,000 men. You have, what, half that? Not even?"
7721,4,8,SNOW,"Aye, you have the numbers. Will your men want to fight for you when they hear you wouldn’t fight for them? RAMSAY points at JON SNOW."
7722,4,8,RAMSAY,"He’s good. Very good. Tell me, will you let your little brother die because you’re too proud to surrender?"
7723,4,8,SANSA,How do we know you have him? RAMSAY nods to SMALLJON. SMALLJON pulls SHAGGYDOG’s head out from a satchel and throws it on the ground.
7724,4,8,RAMSAY,"Now, if you want to save —"
7725,4,8,SANSA,"You’re going to die tomorrow, Lord Bolton. Sleep well. SANSA turns her horse and rides away. RAMSAY (to JON SNOW): She’s a fine woman, your sister. I look forward to having her back in my bed. And you’re all fine-looking men. My dogs are desperate to meet you. I haven’t fed them for seven days. They’re ravenous. I wonder which parts they’ll try first. Your eyes? Your balls? We’ll find out soon enough. In the morning, then, bastard. RAMSAY and company ride back towards Winterfell. JON SNOW looks down."
7726,4,8,TO,"STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT JON SNOW, DAVOS, TORMUND, and SANSA are standing around a planning table."
7727,4,8,SNOW,"If he was smart, he’d stay inside the walls of Winterfell and wait us out."
7728,4,8,DAVOS,"That’s not his way. He knows the North is watching. If the other houses sense weakness on his part, they’ll stop fearing him. He can’t have that. Fear is his power."
7729,4,8,SNOW,"It’s his weakness, too. His mean don’t want to fight for him. They’re forced to fight for him. If they feel the tide turning..."
7730,4,8,TORMUND,It’s not his men that worry me. It’s his horses. I know what mounted knights can do to us. TORMUND looks at DAVOS.
7731,4,8,TORMUND,You and Stannis cut through us like piss through snow.
7732,4,8,SNOW,"We’re digging trenches all along our flanks. They won’t be able to hit us the way that Stannis hit you, in a double envelopment. TORMUND stares blankly at JON SNOW."
7733,4,8,SNOW,A pincer move. TORMUND stares blankly at JON SNOW. JON SNOW and DAVOS look at each other briefly.
7734,4,8,SNOW,They won’t be able to hit us from the sides.
7735,4,8,TORMUND,Good.
7736,4,8,DAVOS,"It’s crucial that we let them charge at us. They’ve got the numbers, we need the patience. If we let him buckle our center, he’ll pursue. Then we’ll have him surrounded on three sides. TORMUND (to JON SNOW): Did you really think that cunt would fight you man to man?"
7737,4,8,SNOW,No. But I wanted to make him angry. I want him coming at us full tilt.
7738,4,8,DAVOS,We should all get some sleep.
7739,4,8,TORMUND,"Rest, Jon Snow. We need you sharp tomorrow. DAVOS, TORMUND, and any remaining attendants exit. JON SNOW sits down at the head of the table."
7740,4,8,SANSA,"So you’ve met the enemy, drawn up your battle plans."
7741,4,8,SNOW,"Aye, for what they’re worth."
7742,4,8,SANSA,"You’ve known him for the space of a single conversation, you and your trusted advisors, and you sit around and make your plans on how to defeat a man you don’t know. I lived with him. I know the way his mind works. I know how he likes to hurt people. Did it ever once occur to you that I might have some insight?"
7743,4,8,SNOW,You’re right.
7744,4,8,SANSA,You think he’s going to fall into your trap. He won’t He’s the one who lays traps.
7745,4,8,SNOW,He’s overconfident.
7746,4,8,SANSA,He plays with people. He’s far better at it than you. He’s been doing it all his life. JON SNOW stands.
7747,4,8,SNOW,"Aye, and what have I been doing all my life? Playing with broomsticks? I fought beyond the Wall against worse than Ramsay Bolton. I’ve defended the Wall from worse than Ramsay Bolton."
7748,4,8,SANSA,You don’t know him.
7749,4,8,SNOW,"All right, tell me. What should we do? How do we get Rickon back?"
7750,4,8,SANSA,"We’ll never get him back. Rickon is Ned Starks trueborn son, which makes him a greater threat to Ramsay than you, a bastard, or me, a girl. As long as he lives, Ramsay’s claim to Winterfell will be contested, which means he won’t live long."
7751,4,8,SNOW,We can’t give up on our brother.
7752,4,8,SANSA,"Listen to me, please. He wants you to make a mistake."
7753,4,8,SNOW,Of course he does. What should I do differently?
7754,4,8,SANSA,I don’t know! I don’t know anything about battles! Just don’t do what he wants you to do.
7755,4,8,SNOW,"Aye, that’s good advice."
7756,4,8,SANSA,You think that’s obvious?
7757,4,8,SNOW,"Well, it is a bit obvious."
7758,4,8,SANSA,"If you had asked for my advice earlier, I would have told you not to attack Winterfell until we have a larger force, or is that obvious, too?"
7759,4,8,SNOW,When will we have a larger force?! We’ve pleaded with every house that’ll have us! The Blackfish can’t help us! We’re lucky to have this many men!
7760,4,8,SANSA,It’s not enough!
7761,4,8,SNOW,"Now, it’s not enough! It’s what we have! Battles have been won against greater odds."
7762,4,8,SANSA,"If Ramsay wins, I’m not going back there alive. Do you understand me? JON SNOW I won’t ever let him touch you again. I’ll protect you, I promise."
7763,4,8,SANSA,"No one can protect me. No one can protect anyone. SANSA exits. JON SNOW turns, looks at the table, and sighs."
7764,4,8,TO,STARK ENCAMPMENT DAVOS and TORMUND are walking together through the encampment.
7765,4,8,DAVOS,You think there’s hope?
7766,4,8,TORMUND,"I’ve never seen these Bolton fuckers fight. And they’ve never seen the free folk fight, so, yes, there’s hope. You want to avenge your king, don’t you?"
7767,4,8,DAVOS,It wasn’t the Boltons defeated Stannis. It was Stannis himself. I loved the man. He lifted me up and made me something. But he had demons in his skull whispering foul things.
7768,4,8,TORMUND,You saw these demons?
7769,4,8,DAVOS,What? They stop walking. DAVOS looks at TORMUND.
7770,4,8,DAVOS,"No, it’s a manner of speaking. Not actual demons."
7771,4,8,TORMUND,"Oh. Well, you loved that cunt Stannis and I loved the man he burned. Mance didn’t have demons in his skull. He didn’t torch people or listen to some red witch. I believed in him. I thought he was the man to lead us through the Long Night. But I was wrong just like you."
7772,4,8,DAVOS,"Maybe that was our mistake, believing in kings."
7773,4,8,TORMUND,Jon Snow’s not a king.
7774,4,8,DAVOS,"No, he’s not. TORMUND and DAVOS smile at each other."
7775,4,8,TORMUND,I need a good drink to help me sleep the night before a fight. You want some? I have a jug of sour goat’s milk stronger than any of that grape water you southern twats like sucking on.
7776,4,8,DAVOS,"No, thanks. It does sound delicious, but I better keep a clear head. I can never sleep the night before a battle."
7777,4,8,TORMUND,So what do you do all night?
7778,4,8,DAVOS,I walk. Think and walk. Think and walk until I’m far enough away from camp that no one can hear me shitting my guts out. TORMUND laughs.
7779,4,8,TORMUND,Happy shitting. TORMUND walks away.
7780,4,8,TO,"STARK ENCAMPMENT - MELISANDRE’S TENT MELISANDRE is sitting at a desk with a mirror and candles on it, staring into a fire pit. JON SNOW enters and approaches her."
7781,4,8,SNOW,My lady. You weren’t at the war council.
7782,4,8,MELISANDRE,I’m not a soldier.
7783,4,8,SNOW,Any advice?
7784,4,8,MELISANDRE,Don’t lose.
7785,4,8,SNOW,"If I do, if I fall, don’t bring me back."
7786,4,8,MELISANDRE,I’ll have to try.
7787,4,8,SNOW,I’m ordering you not to bring me back.
7788,4,8,MELISANDRE,"I am not your servant, Jon Snow."
7789,4,8,SNOW,You’re in my camp. I’m the commander.
7790,4,8,MELISANDRE,I serve the Lord of Light. I do what he commands.
7791,4,8,SNOW,How do you know what he commands?
7792,4,8,MELISANDRE,"I interpret his signs as well as I can. If the Lord didn’t want me to bring you back, how did I bring you back? I have no power. Only what he gives me and he gave me you."
7793,4,8,SNOW,Why?
7794,4,8,MELISANDRE,I don’t know. Maybe you’re only needed for this small part of his plan and nothing else. Maybe he brought you here to die again.
7795,4,8,SNOW,What kind of god would do something like that?
7796,4,8,MELISANDRE,The one we’ve got. JON SNOW stares into the fire pit and then exits.
7797,4,8,TO,"STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTS DAVOS is walking alone through the snow. He happens upon a pile of wooden rubble and stops to inspect it. He sees a charred statuette of a stag in the wood and stops to pick it up. He looks back at the pile of wood. A horn blows in the distance. DAVOS looks in the direction of the horn, then hands his head. INT. MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM DAENERYS is sitting on the throne. TYRION stands beside her. They are attending to THEON and YARA, who are standing on the steps in front of them. TYRION (to THEON): Last time we saw each other was at Winterfell, yes? You were making jokes about my height, I seem to recall. Everyone who makes a joke about a dwarf’s height thinks he’s the only person ever to make a joke about a dwarf’s height. “The height of nobility,” “a man of your stature,” “someone to look up to.” You’re all making the same five or six jokes."
7798,4,8,THEON,It was a long time ago.
7799,4,8,TYRION,"It was. And how have things been going for you since then? Not so well, I gather. Can’t imagine you would have murdered the Stark boys if things had been going well."
7800,4,8,THEON,I didn’t murder the Stark boys. But I did things that were just as bad or worse.
7801,4,8,YARA,And he paid for them.
7802,4,8,TYRION,"Doesn’t seem like it. He’s still alive. It was complicated for you, I’m sure, growing up at Winterfell. Never quite knowing who you were. But then, we all live complicated lives, don’t we?"
7803,4,8,DAENERYS,"You’ve brought us 100 ships from the Iron Fleet with men to sail them. In return, I expect you want me to support your claim to the throne of the Iron Islands?"
7804,4,8,THEON,Not my claim. Hers.
7805,4,8,DAENERYS,And what’s wrong with you?
7806,4,8,THEON,I’m not fit to rule.
7807,4,8,TYRION,We can agree upon that at least.
7808,4,8,DAENERYS,Has the Iron Islands ever had a queen before?
7809,4,8,YARA,No more than Westeros. DAENERYS smiles.
7810,4,8,THEON,Our Uncle Euron returned home after a long absence. He murdered our father and took the Salt Throne from yara. He would have murdered us if we had stayed.
7811,4,8,DAENERYS,Lord Tyrion tells me your father was a terrible king.
7812,4,8,YARA,You and I have that in common.
7813,4,8,DAENERYS,We do. And both murdered by a usurper as well. DAENERYS turns to TYRION.
7814,4,8,DAENERYS,Will their ships be enough?
7815,4,8,TYRION,"With the former Masters’ fleet, possibly. Barely. There are more than 100 ships in the Iron Fleet."
7816,4,8,THEON,There are and Euron is building more. He’s going to offer them to you.
7817,4,8,DAENERYS,So why shouldn’t I wait for him?
7818,4,8,THEON,The Iron Fleet isn’t all he’s bringing. He also wants to give you --
7819,4,8,YARA,"His big cock, I think he said. Euron’s offer is also an offer of marriage, you see. You won’t get one without the other."
7820,4,8,DAENERYS,And I imagine your offer is free of any marriage demands?
7821,4,8,YARA,"I never demand, but I’m up for anything, really."
7822,4,8,THEON,He murdered our father and would have murdered us. He’ll murder you as soon as you have what he wants.
7823,4,8,TYRION,The Seven Kingdoms.
7824,4,8,THEON,All of them.
7825,4,8,DAENERYS,And you don’t want the Seven Kingdoms?
7826,4,8,THEON,Your ancestors defeated ours and took the Iron Islands. We ask you to give them back.
7827,4,8,DAENERYS,And that’s all?
7828,4,8,YARA,We’d like you to help us murder an uncle or two who don’t think a woman’s fit to rule.
7829,4,8,DAENERYS,Reasonable.
7830,4,8,TYRION,What if everyone starts demanding their independence?
7831,4,8,DAENERYS,"She’s not demanding, she’s asking. The others are free to ask as well. Our father were evil men, all of us here. They left the world worse than they found it. We’re not going to do that. We’re going to leave the world better than we found it. DAENERYS stands and approaches YARA."
7832,4,8,DAENERYS,"You will support my claim as queen of the Seven Kingdoms and respect the integrity of the Seven Kingdoms. No more reaving, roving, raiding, or raping."
7833,4,8,YARA,That’s our way of life.
7834,4,8,DAENERYS,No more. YARA and THEON look at each other. THEON nods. YARA turns back to DAENERYS.
7835,4,8,YARA,"No more. YARA extends her hand to DAENERYS. DAENERYS looks back at TYRION. TYRION makes a shaking motion with his hand. DAENERYS and YARA grab each other’s arms. EXT. WINTERFELL - OUTSKIRTS The Stark and Bolton armies sit across the battlefield from one another. DAVOS sits on horseback among the ranks of the Stark army. JON SNOW rides his own horse through the ranks, looking at the men. He rides up next to TORMUND and WUN WUN, at the front of the line. Across the battlefield, X-shaped pyres resembling the sigil of House Bolton are burning. Attached to each of them is the body of a flayed man, strapped upside down. RAMSAY rides through the ranks of the Bolton army on horseback with a rope in his hand. RAMSAY reaches the front of the line and dismounts. The rope is revealed to be tied around RICKON’s hands. RAMSAY ushers RICKON a little further out past the front line and stares at JON SNOW across the field. He unsheathes a dagger and raises it in the air. JON SNOW dismounts and walks a few paces out into the field. RAMSAY lowers the dagger and cuts RICKON’s bindings."
7836,4,8,RAMSAY,"Do you like games, little man? Let’s play a game. Run to your brother. The sooner you make it to him, the sooner you get to see him. That’s it. That’s the game. Easy. Ready? Go. RICKON starts walking out into the field, then looks back at RAMSAY."
7837,4,8,RAMSAY,"No, you have to run, remember? Those are the rules. A soldier approaches and hands RAMSAY his bow. RICKON starts running across the field. RAMSAY draws an arrow from his quiver. JON SNOW jumps on his horse and begins galloping across the field towards RICKON. RAMSAY notches an arrow and fires. The arrow lands in the ground next to RICKON. RAMSAY fires another arrow. It lands on the ground next to RICKON. JON SNOW and RICKON are getting closer. JON SNOW extends his hand out to RICKON. RAMSAY shoots another arrow. It misses. JON SNOW and RICKON are feet away from each other. An arrow pierces through RICKON’s chest from behind. RICKON falls to the ground. JON comes to a halt beside him and looks down at him. RICKON gasps and then dies. JON SNOW looks up at RAMSAY. TORMUND (to himself): Don’t. RAMSAY smiles and gives his bow back to the soldier."
7838,4,8,DAVOS,Prepare to charge! Prepare to charge! The Bolton archers draw and loose a volley of arrows. JON SNOW ushers his horse into a gallop straight towards the Bolton army.
7839,4,8,DAVOS,Go! Go! Follow your commander!
7840,4,8,TORMUND,"Run and fight! WUN WUN roars. The bulk of the Stark forces charge across the field towards the Boltons. JON SNOW continues to rush the Bolton forces alone. The Bolton arches released a volley of arrows, some of which land in the body of JON SNOW’s horse, causing him and his horse to tumble to the ground."
7841,4,8,RAMSAY,Now.
7842,4,8,KARSTARK,"Cavalry, charge! JON SNOW stands to face the Bolton cavalry, charging at him. He takes off his sword belt and draws his sword. The cavalry approaches. Just before it’s upon him, the Stark forces rush past JON SNOW and collide with the Bolton charge. Men on both sides die in the frenzy. Bodies and weaponry fly everywhere. Archers on both sides of the battlefield nock arrows and draw their bows."
7843,4,8,DAVOS,We’ll just kill our own men. Stand down. The Stark arches do not fire.
7844,4,8,RAMSAY,"Loose! The Bolton archers fire. Their arrows rain down on Stark and Bolton men alike. In the fray, JON SNOW dodges several horses which gallop past him. One Bolton cavalryman charges with his horse, but JON SNOW cuts him down. JON SNOW rushes forward and kills a man on the ground, then slices the belly of a second man. A volley of arrows rains down around JON SNOW. He ducks. None of the arrows hit him. He returns to his feet and cuts down another man, dodges the strike of a passing Bolton cavalryman, and runs through another Bolton footsoldier. A Stark footsoldier helps him finish the Bolton man, and JON SNOW grabs him by the shirt."
7845,4,8,SNOW,"Get word -- The Stark footsoldier is taken in the head by an arrow. JON SNOW stares down at the man and then flies into a rage, killing two more Bolton soldiers. A third man runs at him but is knocked down by a galloping horse. JON SNOW runs over to where he landed and stabs him several times. A horseman gallops at JON SNOW with his ax ready, but a passing Stark cavalryman spears him. Another Bolton footsoldier approaches JON SNOW, but JON SNOW cuts him down. The bodies are beginning to pile up on the battlefield. RAMSAY’s archers loose several more volleys. JON SNOW goes into a frenzy, killing many Bolton men. The bodies have piled up high enough to create small mountains of bodies. Men continue to fight atop and around them."
7846,4,8,DAVOS,We may as well be taking shits back here. DAVOS dismounts his horse.
7847,4,8,DAVOS,"Follow! DAVOS unsheathes his sword and charges across the field. The remainder of the Stark forces charge after him. On the other side of the battlefield, RAMSAY smiles and acknowledges SMALLJON."
7848,4,8,RAMSAY,"It’s time, go. SMALLJON brandishes his sword and walks back and forth in front of his men."
7849,4,8,SMALLJON,Who owns the North?
7850,4,8,ALL,We do!
7851,4,8,SMALLJON,Who owns the North?
7852,4,8,ALL,We do!
7853,4,8,SMALLJON,"Show me! SMALLJON and his men cheer and charge across the battlefield. JON SNOW continues fighting, but is knocked to the ground by a Bolton footsoldier. TORMUND appears and stabs the footsoldier through the back , then helps JON SNOW to his feet."
7854,4,8,TORMUND,"Hey! WUN WUN and the Wildlings charge up behind TORMUND and JON SNOW. SMALLJON and his men are charging from the other side. WUN WUN points at them and grunts. A force of Bolton men appear bearing tall shields and spears. They create a half-circle around JON SNOW, TORMUND, DAVOS, WUN WUN, and the entire Stark forces. The other half of the circle is blocked by the piles of bodies on the battlefield. The shield soldiers set their shields firmly in the dirt, then point their spears inward towards the Stark forces."
7855,4,8,MAN,"Infantry, advance! The shield soldiers grunt in unison, lift their shields, and move in towards the Stark forces. With each wave of movement, they stab more and more Stark soldiers with their spears. One Stark soldier tries to climb up over the piles of bodies but gets cut down by SMALLJON. SMALLJON and his men charge down over the bodies, taking the Stark forces from the rear."
7856,4,8,DAVOS,"With me, lads! Break their line! WUN WUN rushes the shield wall and swipes at the spears. TORMUND jumps to the side of some spears and attacks a man behind the shield wall. Several other Stark men rush towards the shield wall. JON SNOW and other Stark soldiers defend against SMALLJON’s men. Many soldiers die on both sides, and the bodies begin to pile up again. WUN WUN rips a man in half. TORMUND pulls a shieldbearer down and kills him, but gets sliced across the arm and is fored to fall back among the Stark ranks."
7857,4,8,MAN,"Tormund! MAN #2: Get him back! The shieldbearers advance, pushing the Stark forces further in on themselves. More Stark men die."
7858,4,8,TORMUND,"Fuck this, come on! TORMUND leads the Wildlings back towards the piles of bodies. JON SNOW and SMALLJON spot each other, but before they can engage, the Wildling charge overtakes them. In the fray, JON SNOW is pushes to the bottom of several bodies and starts getting crushed. He struggles to get out, but can’t get a hold. TORMUND faces off against SMALLJON. TORMUND punches SMALLJON in the face, and SMALLJON responds with an overhead swing of his sword. TORMUND blocks it. More and more bodies are piling on top of JON SNOW. He can see glimpses of clashes and flailing limbs above, but nothing else. He gasps for air. SMALLJON knocks TORMUND to the ground and punches him in the face multiple times. Men are dying all around JON SNOW as he is being trampled. JON SNOW grabs onto the clothes of a standing men and hoists himself up. He emerges in the center of a tightly packed group of his men and fills his lungs with air. He spots WUN WUN fighting off some shieldbearers. WUN WUN is stabbed in the side, grunts, and pulls the spear out. SMALLJON repeatedly headbutts TORMUND in the face. DAVOS and JON SNOW look at each other. A horn begins to sound in the distance. SMALLJON stops headbutting TORMUND. TORMUND seizes the opportunity and tears into the skin of SMALLJON’s neck with his teeth, then draws a small knife and stabs SMALLJON repeatedly. RAMSAY looks in the direction of the sounding horn. A force of cavalry appears across the battlefield carrying flags bearing the white falcon sigil of House Arryn. SANSA and PETYR BAELISH sit on horseback beside the charging Arryn cavalry. TORMUND kills SMALLJON and screams. The Arryn cavalry takes the Bolton shieldbearers from the rear, then circles around and knocks them all down. SANSA smiles. JON SNOW climbs up to the top of the piles of bodies and spots RAMSAY on his horse. WUN WUN and TORMUND climb up beside JON SNOW. RAMSAY sees JON SNOW, turns his horse around, and rides back towards Winterfell. JON SNOW, TORMUND, and WUN WUN chase after him. SANSA watches them go."
7859,4,8,TO,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD RAMSAY and several Bolton soldiers enter the courtyard through Winterfell’s main gate. Some men close and bar the gate behind them and they dismount.
7860,4,8,RAMSAY,Their army’s gone.
7861,4,8,MAN,Our army’s gone.
7862,4,8,RAMSAY,"We have Winterfell. They don’t have the men for a siege. All we have to do is wait. Something thuds against the gate. RAMSAY turns to look at it. Several Bolton archers nock arrows. Several more thuds occur against the other side of the gate. WUN WUN busts a hole in the gate . BOLTON archers shoot arrows at his hand and down at his body over the side of the castle wall. WUN WUN roars and punches another hole in the gate. RAMSAY moves farther away from the gate’s interior. WUN WUN reaches in and grabs the wooden bar holding the gate, but a Bolton soldier throws a spear through the back of his hand. WUN WUN rips his hand away and then bursts through the gate, opening it. He sprints into the courtyard, then falls to his knees. The Bolton archers continue shooting arrows into him. He roars. Stark soldiers flood the courtyard and beginning killing the Bolton soldiers, quickly overtaking them. JON SNOW enters the courtyard and runs up beside WUN WUN. They look at each other. TORMUND runs up beside WUN WUN, on his other side. JON SNOW reaches out to WUN WUN, but RAMSAY shoots WUN WUN in the eye with an arrow, killing him. RAMSAY (to JON SNOW): You suggested one on one combat, didn’t you? Stark archers aim their bows at RAMSAY."
7863,4,8,RAMSAY,"I’ve reconsidered. I think that sounds like a wonderful idea. RAMSAY notches an arrow. JON SNOW drops his sword and picks up a shield. RAMSAY aims at JON SNOW and fires. JON SNOW raises his shield and blocks the arrow. JON SNOW advances. RAMSAY nocks another arrow and fires. JON SNOW raises his shield and blocks the arrow. JON SNOW advances. RAMSAY nocks a third arrow and fires. JON SNOW raises his shield and blocks the arrow. JON SNOW advances. Before RAMSAY can nock a fourth arrow, JON SNOW overtakes him. JON SNOW bashes RAMSAY with his shield twice, knocking him over. JON SNOW drops his shield and jumps on top of RAMSAY, then punches him in the raise over and over. RAMSAY’s faces becomes mangled and bleeds. SANSA enters the courtyard. JON SNOW sees her and stops punching RAMSAY. He stands and walks away. The Bolton flags fall away from the walls of Winterfell and are replaced by Stark flags. MELISANDRE watches from a balcony. DAVOS, holding the charred stag statuette, stares up at her. Some Stark men carry RICKON’s body into the courtyard on a stretcher and stop in front of JON SNOW, TORMUND, and SANSA."
7864,4,8,SNOW,We’re going to bury my brother in the crypt next to my father. The stretcher men continue on. JON SNOW turns to walk away.
7865,4,8,SANSA,Jon. JON SNOW turns back to face SANSA.
7866,4,8,SANSA,Where is he?
7867,4,8,TO,"WINTERFELL - KENNELS RAMSAY is tied to a chair inside the kennel gates. He is mangled and bleeding. He groans and coughs, then raises his head to see SANSA standing outside the gate."
7868,4,8,RAMSAY,"Ah. Sansa. Hello, Sansa. Is this where I’ll be staying now? No. Our time together is about to come to an end. That’s all right. You can’t kill me. I’m part of you now."
7869,4,8,SANSA,Your words will disappear. Your house will disappear. Your name will disappear. All memory of you will disappear. The dogs growl in their cells and begin filtering out into the kennel.
7870,4,8,RAMSAY,My hounds will never harm me.
7871,4,8,SANSA,You haven’t fed them in seven days. You said it yourself.
7872,4,8,RAMSAY,They’re loyal beasts.
7873,4,8,SANSA,They were. Now they’re starving. The dogs growl. One approaches RAMSAY from the front and puts its front paws up on his legs. It sniffs RAMSAY’s face.

7894,4,9,SPARROW,Ser Loras Tyrell. Are you prepared to stand trial and profess your guilt or innocence before the Seven?
7895,4,9,LORAS,There’ll be no need for a trial. I confess before the Seven and freely admit to my crimes.
7896,4,9,SPARROW,To which crimes will you be confessing?
7897,4,9,LORAS,All of them. I lay with other men including the traitor Renly Baratheon. The crowd murmurs.
7898,4,9,LORAS,"I perjured myself before the gods. I am guilty of depravity… dishonesty, profligacy, and arrogance. I see that now. I humble myself before the Seven and accept whatever punishment the gods deem just."
7899,4,9,SPARROW,"The gods’ judgment is fierce, but also fair. The Warrior punishes those who believe themselves beyond the reach of justice. But the Mother shows her mercy to those who kneel before her. LORAS kneels."
7900,4,9,LORAS,I take full responsibility for my many sins and unburden myself of my desires. My only remaining wish is to devote my life to the Seven. May I be a living example of their grace for others to witness.
7901,4,9,SPARROW,You understand fully what this means?
7902,4,9,LORAS,I do. I will abandon the Tyrell name and all that goes with it. I will renounce my lordship and my claims on Highgarden. I will never marry and I will never father children.

7944,4,9,TO,"RED KEEP - CERSEI’S CHAMBER CERSEI is standing at the balcony, staring out at the Great Sept of Baelor."

7954,4,9,TO,GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR MARGAERY (to the crowd): We all need to leave now! MARGAERY hurries over to LORAS. The crowd begins to stir. MARGAERY takes LORAS’ chin and lifts his face so his eyes meet hers.

7962,4,9,TO,"GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - TUNNELS The flame from the candle touches the pool of green liquid and ignites it. The surrounding barrels are ignited and explode in a mass of green flame. LANCEL is incinerated. The explosion travels down the tunnel, igniting all of the barrels."
7963,4,9,TO,"GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR The sound of an explosion can be heard. The green flame erupts from the center of the sept, incinerating the HIGH SPARROW and then engulfing the entire sept, killing everyone inside. The sept crumbles from the force of the explosion.

7968,4,9,UNELLA,No.
7969,4,9,CERSEI,"Confess. CERSEI pours the pitcher into SEPTA UNELLA’s face. SEPTA UNELLA sputters and struggles. When the pitcher is empty, SEPTA UNELLA gasps for air."
7970,4,9,CERSEI,"Confess. It felt good. Beating me, starving me, frightening me, humiliating me. You didn’t do it because you cared about my atonement. You did it because it felt good. I understand. I do things because they feel good. I drink because it feels good. I killed my husband because it felt good to be rid of him. I fuck my brother because it feels good to feel him inside me. I lie about fucking my brother… because it feels good to keep our son safe from hateful hypocrites. I killed your High Sparrow… and all his little sparrows… all his septons, all his septas, all his filthy soldiers, because it felt good to watch them burn. It felt good to imagine their shock and their pain. No thought has ever given me greater joy. Even confessing feels good under the right circumstances. CERSEI touches SEPTA UNELLA’s face."
7971,4,9,CERSEI,You’ve always been quiet. CERSEI walks around the table.
7972,4,9,CERSEI,I said my face would be the last thing you saw before you died. Do you remember?
7973,4,9,UNELLA,Good. I’m glad to see your face. I’m ready to meet the gods.

7977,4,9,UNELLA,"No. SEPTA UNELLA struggles against her bindings, then cries out in pain."
7978,4,9,CERSEI,Shame. CERSEI take hold of the door and closes it behind her.
7979,4,9,CERSEI,Shame. SEPTA UNELLA screams.

7981,4,9,TO,RED KEEP - TOMMEN’S CHAMBER TOMMEN is staring out the window.
7982,4,9,ATTENDANT,"I’m very sorry, Your Grace. Very sorry. The attendant exits. TOMMEN takes his crown off his head and walks to another part of the room. He returns to the window, stands up on the sill, and plummets off the edge. INT. THE TWINS A banquet is underway. WALDER FREY is making a toast. JAIME and BRONN sit at the tables with the Frey and Lannister men, listening."
7983,4,9,WALDER,For House Lannister!
7984,4,9,MEN,Hear me roar! The men cheer.
7985,4,9,WALDER,For House Frey!
7986,4,9,MEN,We stand together! The men cheer.
7987,4,9,WALDER,"May we stand together through the centuries, good friends to the last. The men cheer."
7988,4,9,WALDER,"And when we drive our swords through our enemies’ hearts, may we speak the words of our alliance, “The Freys and the Lannisters send their regards.” The men cheer. A handmaiden looks at BRONN and then at JAIME."
7989,4,9,BRONN,"You don’t even have to do anything, do you? JAIME looks at the handmaiden."
7990,4,9,BRONN,"You just sit there, a rich slab of beef, and all the birds come pecking."
7991,4,9,JAIME,You’re welcome to her.
7992,4,9,BRONN,She doesn’t want me. She wants your golden fingers up her twat. JAIME nods at two women standing on the other side of the room.
7993,4,9,JAIME,Those two have their eyes on you. BRONN looks at the women.
7994,4,9,BRONN,"They have their eyes on you, cunt."
7995,4,9,JAIME,Not my type.
7996,4,9,BRONN,Not blonde enough?
7997,4,9,JAIME,"Ladies, have you met Ser Bronn of the Blackwater, hero of the Battle of Blackwater Bay. JAIME looks at BRONN."
7998,4,9,JAIME,There you go.
7999,4,9,BRONN,Maybe I’m not in the mood. The girls approach Bronn.
8000,4,9,BRONN,Fuck it. BRONN stands and approaches the girls.
8001,4,9,BRONN,No need to call me ser just because I’m an anointed knight. WALDER sits down next to JAIME.
8002,4,9,WALDER,This came together rather well. Your father would be pleased.
8003,4,9,JAIME,I’m sure he would be.
8004,4,9,WALDER,Edmure is back in a cell. Can’t go killing my son by law. It wouldn’t be right. Give the family a bad name. WALDER sips his wine.
8005,4,9,WALDER,"So the famous Blackfish killed by footsoldiers, eh? Legendary warrior, everyone said."
8006,4,9,JAIME,"Have you done much fighting yourself, Lord Frey?"
8007,4,9,WALDER,I’m a bit old for all that.
8008,4,9,JAIME,"No, but back in your day."
8009,4,9,WALDER,"The purpose of fighting is defeating your enemies, isn’t it? JAIME nods."
8010,4,9,WALDER,I’ve defeated mine. Riverrun belonged to House Tully for a thousand years. Now it’s mine. What do you call that? Victory.
8011,4,9,JAIME,"Yes, you’re a great conqueror."
8012,4,9,WALDER,"Go on, mock me, boy. You think I mind? The Tullys mocked me for years. The Starks mocked me. Where are they now? You talk about war as if you’re an expert but the one battle I remember you fighting, you were captured by Robb Stark, the Young Wolf. But it doesn’t matter. Here we are now, two kingslayers. We know what it’s like to have them grovel to our faces and snigger behind our backs. We don’t mind, do we? Fear is a marvelous thing."
8013,4,9,JAIME,"They don’t fear the Freys, though. They fear the Lannisters. We gave you the Riverlands to hold the Riverlands. If we have to ride north and take them back for you every time you lose them, why do we need you? JAIME stands and exits. WALDER watches him go. INT. RED KEEP - QYBURN’S LAB CERSEI and QYBURN are standing over TOMMEN’s body. His body is covered in a veil."
8014,4,9,CERSEI,Show me.
8015,4,9,QYBURN,"Your Grace, there’s no need--"
8016,4,9,CERSEI,Show me. QYBURN uncovers TOMMEN’s body. CERSEI stares at it.
8017,4,9,QYBURN,"What are your thoughts concerning the king’s funeral? As the Sept of Baelor is no longer an option, perhaps a ceremony in the throne room?"
8018,4,9,CERSEI,"He should be with his grandfather, his brother, his sister. Burn him and bury his ashes where the sept once stood. EXT. OLDTOWN - OUTSKIRTS A horse-drawn carriage moves down the road, then stops. SAM and GILLY emerge from behind it. GILLY is carrying LITTLE SAM. They walk to a nearby hill look out over a lake. Oldtown stands across the lake. SAM and GILLY marvel at it."
8019,4,9,TO,"THE CITADEL SAM and GILLY enter and walk to the front desk. A maester is sitting behind the desk, holding spectacles up to his eyes and reading."
8020,4,9,SAM,"Hello. The maester keeps reading and then looks up at SAM, removing his spectacles."
8021,4,9,SAM,"From Lord Commander Snow at Castle Black. SAM holds up a letter. The maester puts down his spectacles and opens his palm. SAM reaches across the table with the letter, offering it to the maester. The maester does not retrieve it. SAM presses himself against the desk, leans further in, and places the letter directly in the maester’s hand. The maester takes the letter, breaks the seal, and reads it."
8022,4,9,SAM,I’m-- I’m to be the new maester. The maester looks at SAM and then opens a large book. He flips a few pages.
8023,4,9,MAESTER,Oh. The maester points his finger to a line of text on the open page.
8024,4,9,MAESTER,"According to our records, Jeor Mormont is Lord Commander."
8025,4,9,SAM,He died.
8026,4,9,MAESTER,We received no report from the maester at Castle Black.
8027,4,9,SAM,Maester Aemon became quite ill shortly after the election. He’s since passed away. Which is why I’m here.
8028,4,9,MAESTER,This is irregular.
8029,4,9,SAM,"Yes, well, I suppose that life is irregular. The maester stares blankly at SAM, then picks up a quill and crosses off two lines of text in the open book."
8030,4,9,MAESTER,"The archmaester will discuss these irregularities with you. In the meantime, you are permitted to use the library. Follow me. The maester stands and begins walking away. SAM and GILLY start to follow him. He turns back and looks at GILLY."
8031,4,9,MAESTER,"No women or children! The maester turns and walks away. SAM makes several baffled gestures to GILLY and then follows the maester. They enter a small hallway full of books. The maester stops in front of a dark side passage and gestures towards it. SAM starts down the passage. The maester leaves. On his way through, SAM touches several of the books lining the shelves. SAM emerges onto the other side of the passage. The passage opens onto an enormous library with a chandelier dangling from the ceiling that reflects light. SAM gets teary and smiles. EXT. WINTERFELL - OUTSKIRTS A white raven flies over the Northern wilderness towards Winterfell."
8032,4,9,TO,"WINTERFELL - DINING HALL JON SNOW is standing behind the high table, staring across the hall. MELISANDRE stands by his side."
8033,4,9,SNOW,"When we had feasts, our family would sit up here… and I’d sit down there. JON SNOW points to the other end of the hall."
8034,4,9,MELISANDRE,"Could have been worse, Jon Snow. You had a family. You had feasts. JON SNOW chuckles."
8035,4,9,SNOW,"Aye, you’re right. I was luckier than most. DAVOS enters the hall and tosses the charred stag statuette at MELISANDRE. MELISANDRE catches it."
8036,4,9,SNOW,What is that?
8037,4,9,DAVOS,Tell him. Tell him who it belonged to.
8038,4,9,MELISANDRE,The Princess Shireen.
8039,4,9,DAVOS,Tell him what you did to her. Tell him!
8040,4,9,MELISANDRE,We burned her at the stake.
8041,4,9,DAVOS,Why?
8042,4,9,MELISANDRE,The army was trapped. The horses were dying. It was the only way.
8043,4,9,DAVOS,You burned a little girl alive!
8044,4,9,MELISANDRE,I only do what my Lord commands!
8045,4,9,DAVOS,"If he commands you to burn children, your Lord is evil!"
8046,4,9,MELISANDRE,We are standing here because of him. Jon Snow is alive because the Lord willed it.
8047,4,9,DAVOS,I loved that girl like she was my own. She was good. She was kind. And you killed her!
8048,4,9,MELISANDRE,So did her father. So did her mother. Her own blood knew it was the only way.
8049,4,9,DAVOS,"The only way for what? They all died anyway! You told everyone Stannis was the one. You had him believing it, all of them fooled. And you lied."
8050,4,9,MELISANDRE,I didn’t lie. I was wrong.
8051,4,9,DAVOS,"Aye, you were wrong. How many died because you were wrong? DAVOS and MELISANDRE stare at each other in silence. DAVOS (to JON SNOW): I ask your leave to execute this woman for murder. She admits to the crime. JON SNOW (to MELISANDRE): Do you have anything to say for yourself?"
8052,4,9,MELISANDRE,"I’ve been ready to die for many years. If the Lord was done with me, so be it, but he’s not. You’ve seen the Night King, Jon Snow. You know the great war is still to come. You know the army of the dead will be upon us soon. And you know I can help you win that war. JON SNOW approaches MELISANDRE."
8053,4,9,SNOW,"Ride south today. If you return to the North, I’ll have you hanged as a murderer. MELISANDRE puts the stag statuette down on the high table and begins to walk away. DAVOS moves in her way."
8054,4,9,DAVOS,"If you ever come back this way, I will execute you myself. MELISANDRE moves past DAVOS and exits."
8055,4,9,TO,WINTERFELL - OUTER WALL JON SNOW stands atop the outer wall watching MELISANDRE ride south on her horse. SANSA appears.
8056,4,9,SNOW,I’m having the lord’s chamber prepared for you.
8057,4,9,SANSA,Mother and Father’s room? You should take it.
8058,4,9,SNOW,I’m not a Stark.
8059,4,9,SANSA,You are to me.
8060,4,9,SNOW,You’re the Lady of Winterfell. You deserve it. We’re standing here because of you. The battle was lost until the Knights of the Vale rode in. They came because of you. You told me Lord Baelish sold you to the Boltons.
8061,4,9,SANSA,He did.
8062,4,9,SNOW,And you trust him?
8063,4,9,SANSA,"Only a fool would trust Littlefinger. I should have told you about him, about the Knights of the Vale. I’m sorry. JON SNOW approaches SANSA."
8064,4,9,SNOW,"We need to trust each other. We can’t fight a war amongst ourselves. We have so many enemies now. JON SNOW touches SANSA’s face and kisses her on the forehead, then turns to walk away."
8065,4,9,SANSA,Jon. JON SNOW turns back to face SANSA.
8066,4,9,SANSA,A raven came from the Citadel. A white raven. Winter is here. JON SNOW smiles and looks up at the sky.
8067,4,9,SNOW,"Well, Father always promised, didn’t he? JON SNOW exits. SANSA looks out at the wilderness. EXT. SUNSPEAR - COURTYARD ELLARIA SAND and OLENNA TYRELL are sitting across a table from each other. OBARA SAND, NYMERIA SAND, and TYENE SAND flank ELLARIA."
8068,4,9,OLENNA,"The last time a Tyrell came to Dorne, he was assassinated. 100 red scorpions, was it?"
8069,4,9,ELLARIA,"You have nothing to fear from us, Lady Olenna."
8070,4,9,OLENNA,"You murder your own prince, but you expect me to trust you?"
8071,4,9,OBARA,We invited you to Dorne because we needed your help. You came to Dorne because you needed our help?
8072,4,9,OLENNA,What is your name again? Barbaro?
8073,4,9,OBARA,Obara.
8074,4,9,OLENNA,Obara. You look like an angry little boy. Don’t presume to tell me what I need.
8075,4,9,NYMERIA,"Forgive my sister. What she lacks in diplomacy, she makes--"
8076,4,9,OLENNA,"Do shut up, dear. OLENNA looks at TYENE."
8077,4,9,OLENNA,Anything from you? TYENE opens her mouth to speak.
8078,4,9,OLENNA,No? Good. Let the grown women speak.
8079,4,9,ELLARIA,The Lannisters have declared war on House Tyrell. They have declared war on Dorne. We must be allies now if we wish to survive.
8080,4,9,OLENNA,Cersei stole the future from me. She killed my son. She killed my grandson. She killed my granddaughter. Survival is not what I’m after now.
8081,4,9,ELLARIA,You’re absolutely right. I chose the wrong words. It is not survival I offer. It is your heart’s desire. ELLARIA rings a bell.
8082,4,9,OLENNA,And what is my heart’s desire?
8083,4,9,ELLARIA,Vengeance. Justice. VARYS emerges from a hallway.
8084,4,9,VARYS,"Fire and blood. INT. MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOM DAENERYS is sitting on a couch, sipping a glass of wine. DAARIO enters."
8085,4,9,DAARIO,Your ships are nearly ready. I saw them painting the sails. DAARIO pours himself a glass of wine.
8086,4,9,DAARIO,I’m curious to see how the Dothraki do on the poison water.
8087,4,9,DAENERYS,You’re not coming with us.
8088,4,9,DAARIO,"New strategy? You want the Second Sons to attack from the west coast? If we take Casterly Rock, the Lannisters will have nowhere to run when you hit King’s Landing. DAARIO approaches DAENERYS and stands in front of her."
8089,4,9,DAENERYS,You’re not going to Westeros. You’re staying here with the Second Sons. There’s finally peace in Meereen. You will keep the peace while the people choose their own leaders. DAARIO sets his glass of wine down on a table.
8090,4,9,DAARIO,"Fuck Meereen. Fuck the people. I’m here for you, not them."
8091,4,9,DAENERYS,"You promised me. “My sword is yours. My life is yours.” This is what I command. If I’m going to rule in Westeros, I’ll need to make alliances. The best way to make alliances is with marriage. DAARIO sits down."
8092,4,9,DAARIO,Who are you marrying this time?
8093,4,9,DAENERYS,I don’t know. Maybe no one.
8094,4,9,DAARIO,But you need to lure all the noble houses to the table? Are you a queen or fish bait?
8095,4,9,DAENERYS,I can’t bring a lover to Westeros.
8096,4,9,DAARIO,A king wouldn’t think twice about it.
8097,4,9,DAENERYS,So that’s what you want? To be my mistress?
8098,4,9,DAARIO,I’m not proud. I don’t care what perfumed aristocrat sits beside you in the throne room. I don’t want a crown. I want you. DAARIO approaches DAENERYS and kneels in front of her.
8099,4,9,DAARIO,I love you. And I make you happy. You know I do. Bring me with you. Let me fight for you. DAENERYS touches DAARIO’s face.
8100,4,9,DAENERYS,I can’t. DAARIO stands.
8101,4,9,DAARIO,The dwarf told you to do this.
8102,4,9,DAENERYS,No one tells me to do anything.
8103,4,9,DAARIO,Clever fellow. Can’t argue with his logic. I’m no use to you over there.
8104,4,9,DAENERYS,Don’t get angry.
8105,4,9,DAARIO,"I’m not angry. I’m full of self-pity. Who comes after you? Who can ever follow Daenerys Stormborn, the Mother of Dragons?"
8106,4,9,DAENERYS,"A great number of women, I imagine. Specific orders will be left for you regarding the welfare of Meereen and the Bay of Dragons. DAENERYS stands."
8107,4,9,DAARIO,Bay of Dragons?
8108,4,9,DAENERYS,"We can’t call it Slaver’s Bay anymore, can we?"
8109,4,9,DAARIO,"You’ll get that throne you want so badly, I’m sure of it. I hope it brings you happiness. DAARIO sips his wine."
8110,4,9,DAARIO,I pity the lord of Westeros. They have no idea what’s coming for them.
8111,4,9,DAENERYS,"Farewell, Daario Naharis. DAARIO nods and exits."
8112,4,9,TO,"MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOM TYRION is sitting off to the side of the room on a bench. DAENERYS enters, walking down the steps from the throne."
8113,4,9,TYRION,How did he take it?
8114,4,9,DAENERYS,No tears.
8115,4,9,TYRION,"I know it was hard for you. You turned away a man who truly loves you because he would have been a liability in the Seven Kingdoms. That’s the kind of self-sacrifice that makes for a good ruler, if it’s any consolation. DAENERYS reaches the bottom of the steps and approaches TYRION."
8116,4,9,DAENERYS,It’s not.
8117,4,9,TYRION,"No, I suppose not. I’m terrible at consoling. DAENERYS sits down on the bench next to TYRION."
8118,4,9,DAENERYS,"Yes, you really are."
8119,4,9,TYRION,"All right, how about the fact that this is actually happening? You have your armies, you have your ships, you have your dragons. Everything you’ve ever wanted since you were old enough to want anything. It’s all yours for the taking. Are you afraid? DAENERYS nods."
8120,4,9,TYRION,Good. You’re in the great game now. And the great game’s terrifying. The only people who aren’t afraid of failure are madmen like your father.
8121,4,9,DAENERYS,Do you know what frightens me? I said farewell to a man who loves me. A man I thought I cared for. And I felt nothing. Just impatient to get on with it.
8122,4,9,TYRION,He wasn’t the first to love you and he won’t be the last.
8123,4,9,DAENERYS,"Well, you have completely failed to console me. DAENERYS stands and turns to face TYRION."
8124,4,9,TYRION,"For what it’s worth, I’ve been a cynic for as long as I can remember. Everyone’s always asking me to believe in things-- family, gods, kings, myself. It was often tempting until I saw where belief got people. So I said no, thank you to belief. And yet here I am. TYRION stands on the bench."
8125,4,9,TYRION,"I believe in you. It’s embarrassing, really. I’d swear you my sword, but I don’t actually own a sword."
8126,4,9,DAENERYS,It’s your counsel I need.
8127,4,9,TYRION,It’s yours. Now and always.
8128,4,9,DAENERYS,"Good. I, um… I had something made for you. I’m not sure if it’s right. DAENERYS pins a Hand of the King’s brooch on TYRION’s chest."
8129,4,9,DAENERYS,"Tyrion Lannister, I name you Hand of the Queen. TYRION holds back tears, then kneels. INT. THE TWINS WALDER FREY is sitting at the high table, eating and drinking. The rest of the dining hall is empty. A handmaiden approaches and sets down a platter of pie on the table in front of him."
8130,4,9,WALDER,"You’re not one of mine, are you?"
8131,4,9,HANDMAIDEN,"No, my lord."
8132,4,9,WALDER,Didn’t think so. Too pretty. WALDER slaps the handmaiden on the buttocks and smiles.
8133,4,9,WALDER,Where are my damn moron sons? Black Walder and Lothar promised to be here by midday.
8134,4,9,HANDMAIDEN,"They’re here, my lord."
8135,4,9,WALDER,"Well, what are they doing, trimming their cunt hairs? Tell them to come here now."
8136,4,9,HANDMAIDEN,"But they’re already here, my lord. WALDER looks around the hall. The handmaiden points to the pie."
8137,4,9,HANDMAIDEN,"Here, my lord. WALDER pulls back the top layer of the pie. A finger protrudes from the center of the slice."
8138,4,9,HANDMAIDEN,They weren’t easy to carve. Especially Black Walder. WALDER breathes heavily.
8139,4,9,WALDER,"What… The handmaiden reaches up to her face and pulls it away, revealing her true identity is ARYA."
8140,4,9,ARYA,"My name is Arya Stark. I want you to know that. The last thing you’re ever going to see is a Stark smiling down at you as you die. ARYA brandishes a knife. WALDER gets up to run, but ARYA grabs him and pulls him back down. She grabs him by the forehead and slits his throat. He convulses and groans as he dies. ARYA smiles and stares at him. EXT. WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE SANSA sits underneath the weirwood tree. PETYR approaches her."
8141,4,9,PETYR,"Forgive me, my lady… if you’re at prayer."
8142,4,9,SANSA,"I’m done with all that. I came here every day when I was a girl. I prayed to be somewhere else. Back then I only ever thought about what I wanted, never about what I had. SANSA stands and walks towards PETYR."
8143,4,9,SANSA,I was a stupid girl.
8144,4,9,PETYR,You were a child.
8145,4,9,SANSA,What do you want?
8146,4,9,PETYR,I thought you knew what I wanted.
8147,4,9,SANSA,I was wrong.
8148,4,9,PETYR,"No, you weren’t. Every time I’m faced with a decision, I close my eyes and see the same picture. Whenever I consider an action, I ask myself will this action help to make this picture a reality? Pull it out of my mind and into the world? And I only act if the answer is yes. A picture of me on the Iron Throne… and you by my side. PETYR leans in to kiss SANSA, but SANSA puts her hand on his chest to stop him."
8149,4,9,SANSA,It’s a pretty picture. SANSA walks past PETYR.
8150,4,9,PETYR,News of this battle will spread quickly through the Seven Kingdoms. I’ve declared for House Stark for all to hear.
8151,4,9,SANSA,"You’ve declared for other houses before, Lord Baelish. It’s never stopped you from serving yourself."
8152,4,9,PETYR,"The past is gone for good. You can sit here mourning its departure or you can prepare for the future. You, my love, are the future of House Stark. Who should the North rally behind? A trueborn daughter of Ned and Catelyn Stark born here at Winterfell or a motherless bastard born in the south? SANSA exits. EXT. BEYOND THE WALL BENJEN stares up at The Wall. BRAN and MEERA wait nearby."
8153,4,9,BENJEN,This is where I leave you.
8154,4,9,MEERA,You’re not coming with us?
8155,4,9,BENJEN,"The Wall is not just ice and stone. Ancient spells were carved into its foundations. Strong magic to protect men from what lies beyond. And while it stands, the dead cannot pass. I cannot pass. BENJEN approaches his horse and lifts BRAN off of it. He carries BRAN to the foot of a nearby weirwood, then walks back to his horse."
8156,4,9,MEERA,Where will you go?
8157,4,9,BENJEN,The great war is coming and I still fight for the living. I’ll do what I can… as long as I can. BENJEN mounts his horse.
8158,4,9,BRAN,"Thank you, Uncle Benjen."
8159,4,9,BENJEN,I wish you both good fortune. BENJEN rides away. BRAN looks at the weirwood and then starts to crawl towards it. MEERA helps him. BRAN reaches out to the weirwood but MEERA grabs his wrist.
8160,4,9,MEERA,Are you sure you’re ready for this?
8161,4,9,BRAN,"I’m the Three-Eyed Raven now. I have to be ready for this. BRAN touches the weirwood tree. EXT. VISION OF THE PAST - TOWER OF JOY NED stands at the base of the Tower of Joy. He heards LYANNA screaming in the Tower and rushes towards the stairs. BRAN stands on the ground behind him. NED turns back as though he hears a noise, but sees nothing. He hurries up the steps. BRAN follows. NED bursts through a door into a bedroom. LYANNA lies in bed. The sheets are soaked with blood. A handmaiden is standing in the corner."
8162,4,9,LYANNA,Ned?
8163,4,9,NED,Lyanna. NED rushes to LYANNA’s side.
8164,4,9,LYANNA,Is that you? Is that really you? LYANNA lifts her hand. NED takes it.
8165,4,9,LYANNA,You’re not a dream.
8166,4,9,NED,"No, I’m not a dream. I’m here. Right here."
8167,4,9,LYANNA,"I’ve missed you, big brother. NED begins to cry."
8168,4,9,NED,"I’ve missed you, too."
8169,4,9,LYANNA,I want to be brave.
8170,4,9,NED,Shh. You are.
8171,4,9,LYANNA,I’m not. NED lifts his hand from LYANNA’s stomach. His palm is covered in blood.
8172,4,9,LYANNA,I don’t want to die.
8173,4,9,NED,You’re not going to die. NED looks at the handmaiden.
8174,4,9,NED,Get her some water!
8175,4,9,LYANNA,"No, no water."
8176,4,9,NED,Is there a maester?
8177,4,9,LYANNA,"Please. Listen to me, Ned. LYANNA whispers in NED’s ear."
8178,4,9,LYANNA,"If Robert finds out, he’ll kill him, you know he will. You have to protect him. Promise me, Ned. Promise me. The handmaiden hands NED the child."
8179,4,9,LYANNA,"Promise me, Ned. Promise me. NED stares down at the baby. The baby opens its eyes. Zoom on the baby’s face. INT. WINTERFELL - DINING HALL Slow zoom out from JON SNOW’s face. JON SNOW is sitting at high table. SANSA sits beside him. Representatives from Northern houses, the Vale, and the wildlings are gathered in the dining hall. TORMUND and DAVOS sit among the wildlings. PETYR stands off to the side, watching."
8180,4,9,KNIGHT,You can’t expect Knights of the Vale to side with wildling invaders.
8181,4,9,TORMUND,We didn’t invade. We were invited.
8182,4,9,KNIGHT,Not by me. JON SNOW stands.
8183,4,9,SNOW,"The free folk, the northerners, and the Knights of the Vale fought bravely, fought together, and we won. My father uses to say we find our true friends on the battlefield. One of the houses’ representatives stands."
8184,4,9,MAN,"The Boltons are defeated. The war is over. Winter has come. If the maesters are right, it’ll be the coldest one in a thousand years. We should ride home and wait out the coming storms."
8185,4,9,SNOW,"The war is not over. And I promise you, friend, the true enemy won’t wait out the storm. He brings the storm. The men begin to murmur. LYANNA MORMONT stands."
8186,4,9,LYANNA,"Your son was butchered at the Red Wedding, Lord Manderly. But you refused the call. You swore allegiance to House Stark, Lord Glover, but in their hour of greatest need, you refused the call. And you, Lord Cerwyn, your father was skinned alive by Ramsay Bolton. Still you refuse the call. But House Mormont remembers. The North remembers. We know no king but the King in the North whose name is Stark. I don’t care if he’s a bastard. Ned Stark’s blood runs through his veins. He’s my king from this day until his last day. The men resume murmuring. LORD MANDERLY stands."
8187,4,9,MANDERLY,"Lady Mormont speaks harshly and truly. My son died for Robb Stark, the Young Wolf. I didn’t think we’d find another king in my lifetime. I didn’t commit my men to your cause ‘cause I didn’t want more Manderlys dying for nothing. But I was wrong. Jon Snow avenged the Red Wedding. He is the White Wolf. The King in the North. MANDERLY draws his blade, then rests it point-down on the ground and kneels. LORD GLOVER stands."
8188,4,9,GLOVER,I did not fight beside you on the field and I will regret that until my dying day. A man can only admit when he was wrong and ask forgiveness.
8189,4,9,SNOW,"There’s nothing to forgive, my lord."
8190,4,9,GLOVER,"There will be more fights to come. House Glover will stand behind House Stark as we have for a thousands years. And I will stand behind Jon Snow… the King in the North! GLOVER draws his blade, then rests it point-down on the ground and kneels."
8191,4,9,GLOVER,The King in the North! Everyone in the hall stands and draws their blades.
8192,4,9,ALL,"The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! JON SNOW stands. SANSA and PETYR look at each other. EXT. KING’S LANDING - OUTSKIRTS JAIME, BRONN, and several Lannister knights are riding on horseback on a high hill. They stop and look out at King’s Landing. JAIME sees smoke billowing out of the ruins of the Great Sept of Baelor."
8193,4,9,JAIME,Come on. JAIME rides on.
8194,4,9,TO,"RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM CERSEI enters, escorted by GREGOR and the Kingsguard. The room is full of nobles and city soldiers. QYBURN stands next to the Iron Throne, holding a crown. CERSEI and GREGOR approach the throne. CERSEI stands in front of the throne. JAIME enters through a side passage and watches."
8195,4,9,QYBURN,"I now proclaim Cersei of the House Lannister First of Her Name, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms. QYBURN places the crown on CERSEI’s head. CERSEI sits in the Iron Throne. She and JAIME look at each other."
8196,4,9,QYBURN,Long may she reign.
8197,5,0,DEFAULT,Dragonstone (Script) Lyrics INT. THE TWINS - BANQUET HALL The Freys are all gathered in the hall. WALDER FREY sits at the high table. WALDER slams his cup down on the table twice. The room grows silent. WALDER stands.
8198,5,0,FREY,"You're wonder why I brought you all here. After all, we just had a feast. Since when does old Walder give us two feasts in a single fortnight? The Freys laugh."
8199,5,0,FREY,"Well, it's no good being lord of the Riverlands if you can't celebrate with your family. That's what I say! The Freys cheer and slam their fists on their tables. WALDER snaps his fingers at a servant girl. The girl begins serving flasks of wine."
8200,5,0,FREY,"I've gathered every Frey who means a damn thing so I can tell you my plans for this great house now that winter has come. But first, a toast! No more of that Dornish horse piss! This is the finest Arbor gold! Proper wine for proper heroes! The Freys cheer. WALDER raises his glass."
8201,5,0,FREY,Stand together! The Freys stand in unison.
8202,5,0,ALL,Stand together! The Freys drink. WALDER holds his cup to his lips but does not drink. The servant girl picks up her cup and motions to drink.
8203,5,0,WALDER,Not you. I'm not wasting good wine on a damn woman. WALDER addresses the hall again.
8204,5,0,WALDER,"Maybe I'm not the most pleasant man. I'll admit it. But I'm proud of you lot. You're my family, the men who helped me slaughter the Starks at the Red Wedding. The Freys cheer."
8205,5,0,WALDER,"Yes, yes. Cheer. Brave men, all of you. Butchered a woman pregnant with her babe. Cut the throat of a mother of five. Slaughtered your guests after inviting them into your home. But you didn't slaughter every one of the Starks. Some of the Freys groan."
8206,5,0,WALDER,"No, no, that was your mistake. You should have ripped them all out, root and stem. The Freys choke, cough, and spit up blood."
8207,5,0,WALDER,"Leave one wolf alive and the sheep are never safe. The Freys collapse and die. WALDER takes hold of his own face and removes it, revealing ARYA's face. ARYA turns to the servant girl."
8208,5,0,ARYA,"When people ask you what happened here, tell them the North remembers. Tell them winter came for House Frey. ARYA walks through the hall, staring at the Frey bodies. She smiles and exits. TITLE SEQUENCE EXT. BEYOND THE WALL The wind blows over the tundra. A dark cloud starts forming on the horizon, growing larger until it consumes everything. A white walker rides into view, accompanied by several other white walkers. The army of the dead files through the darkness. An undead giant walks into view. Zoom on the giant's eye."
8209,5,0,TO,"CASTLE BLACK - EXTERIOR GATE BRAN is lying in his sled. His eyes are pure white. They wash to their normal color. MEERA is standing in front of him, holding the ropes to the sled. The gate rises. DOLOROUS EDD walks through the gate, accompanied by several members of the Night's Watch."
8210,5,0,EDD,You wildlings?
8211,5,0,MEERA,"I'm Meera Reed, daughter of Howland Reed. This is Brandon Stark, son of Ned Stark."
8212,5,0,EDD,How do I know that's true? BRAN raises his head and stares at EDD.
8213,5,0,BRAN,"You were at the Fist of the First Men. You were at Hardhome. You've seen the Army of the Dead. You've seen the Night King. He's coming for us. For all of us. EDD pauses and looks down, then looks to his men."
8214,5,0,EDD,"Okay, come on. Let's get them inside. Two Night's Watch men sheathe their swords, approach BRAN's sled, grab the ropes, and pull him inside the gate. MEERA follows. EDD lingers and stares out into the wild, then turns on his heel and walks through the gate. The gate closes behind him. INT. WINTERFELL - MAIN HALL JON SNOW stands at the high table. SANSA and DAVOS sit at his sides. BRIENNE, PODRIC, TORMUND, PETYR BAELISH, YOHN ROYCE, LYANNA MORMONT, ROBETT GLOVER, and the lords of the northern houses are in attendance."
8215,5,0,JON,"I want every northern maester to scour their records for any mention of dragonglass. Dragonglass kills white walkers. It's more valuable to us now than gold. We need to find it, we need to mine it, we need to make weapons from it. Everyone aged 10 to 60 will drill daily with spears, pikes, bow and arrow."
8216,5,0,ROBETT,It's about time we taught these boys of summer how to fight. The northern lords laugh.
8217,5,0,JON,Not just the boys. BRIENNE looks at JON.
8218,5,0,JON,We can't defend the North if only half the population is fighting. ROBETT stands.
8219,5,0,ROBETT,You expect me to put a spear in my granddaughter's hand? LYANNA stands.
8220,5,0,LYANNA,"I don't plan on knitting by the fire while men fight for me. I might be small, Lord Glover, and I might be a girl, but I am every bit as much a Northerner as you."
8221,5,0,ROBETT,"Indeed you are, my lady. No one has questioned--"
8222,5,0,LYANNA,And I don't need your permission to defend the North. DAVOS smiles. LYANNA turns to JON.
8223,5,0,LYANNA,"We'll begin training every man, woman, boy, and girl on Bear Island. The men pound their tables and shout in agreement. ROBETT nods at LYANNA. ROBETT and LYANNA sit."
8224,5,0,JON,"While we're preparing for attack, we need to shore up our defenses. The only thing standing between us and the Army of the Dead is the Wall and the Wall hasn't been properly manned in centuries. I'm not the king of the Free Folk. JON looks at TORMUND. TORMUND turns and looks at JON."
8225,5,0,JON,But if we're going to survive this winter together... TORMUND grunts and stands.
8226,5,0,TORMUND,You want us to man the castles for you? The men murmur.
8227,5,0,JON,Last time we saw the Night King was at Hardhome. The closest castle to Hardhome is Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.
8228,5,0,TORMUND,Then that's where I'll go. Looks like we're the Night's Watch now. TORMUND sits.
8229,5,0,JON,"If they breach the wall, the first two castles in their path are Last Hearth and Karhold. YOHN stands."
8230,5,0,YOHN,The Umbers and the Karstarks betrayed the North. Their castles should be torn down with not a stone left standing.
8231,5,0,SANSA,"The castles committed no crimes. And we need every fortress we have for the war to come. We should give the Last Hearth and Karhold to new families, loyal families who supported us against Ramsay."
8232,5,0,ALL,Aye! YOHN sits.
8233,5,0,JON,The Umbers and the Karstarks have fought beside the Starks for centuries. They've kept faith for generation after generation.
8234,5,0,SANSA,And then they broke faith.
8235,5,0,JON,I'm not going to strip these families of their ancestral homes because of the crimes of a few reckless sons.
8236,5,0,SANSA,So there's no punishment for treason and no reward for loyalty? The hall goes silent.
8237,5,0,JON,The punishment for treason is death. Smalljon Umber died on the field of battle. Harald Karstark died on the field of battle.
8238,5,0,SANSA,They died fighting for Ramsay. Give the castles to the families of the men who died fighting for you. The men chatter and pound the tables.
8239,5,0,JON,"When I was Lord Commander of the Night's Watch I executed men who betrayed me. I executed men who refused to follow orders. My father always said, ""The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword,"" and I have tried to live by those words. But I will not punish a son for his father's sins, and I will not take a family home away from a family it has belonged to for centuries. That is my decision, and my decision is final. JON stares at SANSA. SANSA looks away. JON addresses the hall."
8240,5,0,JON,"Ned Umber. NED UMBER, a boy, stands."
8241,5,0,JON,"Alys Karstark. ALYS KARSTARK, a young woman, stands. NED and ALYS approach the high table."
8242,5,0,JON,"For centuries, our families fought side by side on the battlefield. I ask you to pledge your loyalty once again to House Stark, to serve as our bannermen and come to our air whenever called upon. NED and ALYS unsheathe their swords and kneel."
8243,5,0,JON,Stand. NED and ALYS stand.
8244,5,0,JON,"Yesterday's wars don't matter anymore. The North needs to band together, all the living north. Will you stand beside me, Ned and Alys, now and always?"
8245,5,0,ALYS,Now and always! The men cheer and pound the tables.
8246,5,0,TO,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY JON walks briskly along the walkway. SANSA follows him.
8247,5,0,JON,"You are my sister, but I am king now."
8248,5,0,SANSA,Will you start wearing a crown?
8249,5,0,JON,"When you question my decisions in front of the other lords and ladies, you undermine me."
8250,5,0,SANSA,So I can't question your decisions anymore?
8251,5,0,JON,"Of course you can, but--"
8252,5,0,SANSA,"Joffrey never let anyone question his authority. You think he was a good king? JON stops walking. SANSA walks past him, then stops and turns to face him."
8253,5,0,JON,Do you think I'm Joffrey?
8254,5,0,SANSA,You're as far from Joffrey as anyone I've ever met.
8255,5,0,JON,Thank you. JON stares out at the yard below.
8256,5,0,SANSA,"You're good at this, you know."
8257,5,0,JON,At what?
8258,5,0,SANSA,At ruling. JON sighs.
8259,5,0,JON,No.
8260,5,0,SANSA,"You are. You are. They respect you, they really do, but you have to-- JON chuckles."
8261,5,0,SANSA,Why are you laughing? JON continues walking. SANSA follows.
8262,5,0,JON,"What did father used to say? Everything before the word ""but"" is horse shit."
8263,5,0,SANSA,He never said that to me.
8264,5,0,JON,"No. No, he never cursed in front of his girls."
8265,5,0,SANSA,"Because he was trying to protect us. He never wanted us to see how dirty the world really is, but Father couldn't protect me and neither can you. Stop trying."
8266,5,0,JON,"All right, I'll stop trying to protect you and you stop trying to undermine me."
8267,5,0,SANSA,I'm not trying to undermine you. SANSA grabs JON's arm and spins him to face her.
8268,5,0,SANSA,"You have to be smarter than Father. You need to be smarter than Robb. I loved them, I miss them, but they made stupid mistakes, and they both lost their heads for it."
8269,5,0,JON,And how should I be smarter? By listening to you?
8270,5,0,SANSA,Would that be so terrible? MAESTER WOLKAN approaches.
8271,5,0,WOLKAN,"A raven from King's Landing, Your Grace. WOLKAN hands a bound note to JON, then bows and leaves. JON unravels the note."
8272,5,0,JON,"""Cersei of House Lannister, First of Her Name, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms--"""
8273,5,0,SANSA,What does she want?
8274,5,0,JON,Come to King's Landing. Bend the knee or suffer the fate of all traitors.
8275,5,0,SANSA,"You've been so consumed with the enemy to the north, you've forgotten about the one to the south."
8276,5,0,JON,"I'm consumed with the Night King because I've seen him. And believe me, you'd think of little else if you had, too."
8277,5,0,SANSA,We still have a wall between us and the Night King. Theres nothing between us and Cersei.
8278,5,0,JON,There's a thousand miles between us and Cersei. Winter is here. The Lannisters are a southern army. They've never ranged this far north.
8279,5,0,SANSA,"You're the military man, but I know her. If you're her enemy, she'll never stop until she's destroyed you. Everyone who's ever crossed her, she's found a way to murder."
8280,5,0,JON,You almost sound as if you admire her.
8281,5,0,SANSA,"I learned a great deal from her. EXT. KING'S LANDING - RED KEEP COURTYARD CERSEI walks atop a mural of Westeros painted on the floor. The painter is completing it. JAIME enters and walks towards CERSEI, then looks at the mural and nods at the painter. The painter puts down his brush and exits."
8282,5,0,JAIME,What is this?
8283,5,0,CERSEI,"Its what we've been waiting for our whole lives. It's what Father trained us for, whether he knew it or not."
8284,5,0,JAIME,"He knew it. Made me memorize every damn city, town, lake, forest, and mountain."
8285,5,0,CERSEI,"It's ours now, we just have to take it. CERSEI turns to face JAIME."
8286,5,0,CERSEI,You've been quiet since you came home. Are you angry with me?
8287,5,0,JAIME,"No, not angry."
8288,5,0,CERSEI,Are you afraid of me?
8289,5,0,JAIME,Should I be?
8290,5,0,CERSEI,"Daenerys Targaryen has chosen Tyrion to be her Hand. Right now, they're sailing across the Narrow Sea, hoping to take back her father's throne. Our little brother, the one you love so much, the one you set free, the one who murdered our father and our first-born son, now he stands beside our enemies and gives them counsel. He's out there somewhere at the head of an armada. Where will they land?"
8291,5,0,JAIME,Dragonstone. JAIME approaches the depiction of Dragonstone in the mural and stands over it.
8292,5,0,JAIME,"They have deep-water ports for the ships. Stannis left the castle unoccupied, and that's where she was born."
8293,5,0,CERSEI,Enemies to the east. CERSEI walks towards Dorne on the mural.
8294,5,0,CERSEI,Enemies to the south--Ellaria Sand and her brood of bitches. CERSEI walks towards Highgarden on the mural.
8295,5,0,CERSEI,"Enemies to the west--Olenna, the old cunt. Another traitor. CERSEi walks towards the North on the mural."
8296,5,0,CERSEI,Enemies to the north. Ned Stark's bastard has been named King in the North and that murdering whore Sansa stands beside him. Enemies everywhere. We're surrounded by traitors. You're in command of the Lannister army now. How do we proceed?
8297,5,0,JAIME,"Winter is here. We can't win a war if we can't feed our men and our horses. The Tyrells have the grain, the Tyrells have the livestock."
8298,5,0,CERSEI,Will the Tyrell bannermen stand alongside a Dothraki horde and Unsullied slave soldiers?
8299,5,0,JAIME,"If they think Daenerys will win. No one wants to fight on the losing side. Right now, we look like the losing side."
8300,5,0,CERSEI,I'm the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.
8301,5,0,JAIME,"Three kingdoms, at best. I'm not sure you understand how much danger we're in."
8302,5,0,CERSEI,I understand we're in a war for survival. I understand whoever loses dies. I understand whoever wins could launch a dynasty that lasts a thousand years.
8303,5,0,JAIME,A dynasty for whom? Our children are dead. We're the last of us.
8304,5,0,CERSEI,"A dynasty for us, then."
8305,5,0,JAIME,We never talked about Tommen. CERSEi turns and walks to a nearby table and pours herself a glass of wine.
8306,5,0,CERSEI,There's nothing to say.
8307,5,0,JAIME,Our baby boy killed himself.
8308,5,0,CERSEI,"He betrayed me. He betrayed us both. Should we spend our days mourning the dead--mother, father, and all our children?"
8309,5,0,JAIME,Cersei--
8310,5,0,CERSEI,"I loved them. I did. But they're ashes now and we're still flesh and blood. We're the last Lannisters, the last ones who count."
8311,5,0,JAIME,Even Lannisters can't survive without allies. Where are our allies now? You saw what happened to Walder Frey and his family.
8312,5,0,CERSEI,I heard. How could we ever trust a man like that?
8313,5,0,JAIME,"We couldn't. He was a useless, old coward, but the Freys supported us. Now they're all dead. Whoever killed them is no friend of ours. We need allies. Stronger, better allies. We can't win this war alone."
8314,5,0,CERSEI,You think I listened to Father for 40 years and learned nothing?
8315,5,0,TO,"KING'S LANDING - BLACKWATER BAY Ships bearing the kraken sigil of House Greyjoy are sailing into port. CERSEI and JAIME watch the boats from the shore, escorted by GREGOR CLEGANE and several other guards."
8316,5,0,JAIME,The Greyjoys? You invited the Greyjoys to King's Landing?
8317,5,0,CERSEI,Not all of them.
8318,5,0,JAIME,"Well, it looks like all of them."
8319,5,0,CERSEI,"I invited Euron Greyjoy, the new King of the Iron Islands. You said yourself we needed stronger, better allies. There you are."
8320,5,0,JAIME,How are they better allies? How are they different from the Freys? They both broke their promises and murdered their former friends as soon as it suited them.
8321,5,0,CERSEI,"So does everyone when it suits them. Unlike the Freys, they have ships. And they're good at killing."
8322,5,0,JAIME,"They're not good at anything. I know the Ironborn. They're bitter, angry little people. All they know how to do is steal things they can't build or grow themselves."
8323,5,0,CERSEI,Euron Greyjoy didn't come here for that.
8324,5,0,JAIME,"Oh, what did he come here for, then?"
8325,5,0,CERSEI,"A queen. CERSEI exits, followed by GREGOR and the guards."
8326,5,0,TO,"KING'S LANDING - RED KEEP GREAT HALL CERSEI sits on the Iron Throne, flanked by JAIME and GREGOR. EURON GREYJOY stands at the foot of the throne. Guards line the hall."
8327,5,0,EURON,"The moment I was chosen Lord of the Iron Islands, they turned on me. Their own uncle. They stole my best ships and ran. Sailed the right across the world and gave them to the Dragon Queen so she could bring her armies here to attack you. EURON points at CERSEI."
8328,5,0,EURON,"It's nothing compares to the treason you suffered at the hands of a family members, from what I hear. But still, it bothers me. Murdering them would make me feel a lot better. And since it appears that all our treasonous family members are fighting for the same side, I thought we rightful monarchs could murder them together. EURON starts walking up towards the throne. GREGOR takes a step towards him. EURON stops walking and looks up at him."
8329,5,0,JAIME,"You're not a rightful monarch, though, are you? EURON smiles and walks backwards off the steps. GREGOR returns to his previous position."
8330,5,0,JAIME,"The Greyjoys rebelled agains the throne for the right to be monarchs, but as I recall, you were soundly defeated. Come to mention it, weren't you the one who started that rebellion by sailing to Casterly Rock and burning the Lannister fleet? You certainly caught us there. Very smart move on your part. Of course, we all made it to the Iron Islands anyway. I was there."
8331,5,0,EURON,"I remember very well. I saw you. I heard so much talk. The best in the world. No one can stop him. I didn't believe it, to be honesty. But I must say, when you rushed through the breach and started cutting people down...it was glorious. Like a dance."
8332,5,0,JAIME,The people I was cutting down were your own kin.
8333,5,0,EURON,The place was getting crowded. I enjoyed watching it. I truly did.
8334,5,0,JAIME,And I enjoyed killing Greyjoys.
8335,5,0,EURON,"A good thing for me. If you hadn't crushed us, I wouldn't have gone into exile. If I hadn't done that, I wouldn't be the greatest captain on the 14 seas."
8336,5,0,CERSEI,If not the most humble.
8337,5,0,EURON,"You're not humble. You're the queen of a great nation. You don't care about the Iron Islands. They're nothing but rocks and bird shit and--and a lot of very unattractive people. The Iron Fleet, on the other hand, that's something else entirely. It's the greatest armada Westeros has ever seen. With the Iron Fleet, you own the seas. You can defeat the invaders of the east and the pretenders of the north and south."
8338,5,0,CERSEI,What do you want in return?
8339,5,0,EURON,"Ever since I was a little boy, I wanted to grow up and mary the most beautiful woman in the world. So here I am, with a thousand ships and two good hands. EURON raises his arms. JAIME's face twists."
8340,5,0,CERSEI,I decline your proposal.
8341,5,0,EURON,Why?
8342,5,0,CERSEI,You're not trustworthy. You've broken promises to allies before and murdered them at the nearest opportunity. You murdered your own brother.
8343,5,0,EURON,You should try it. Feels wonderful. EURON chuckles. JAIME looks at CERSEI.
8344,5,0,EURON,"I don't expect you to trust me outright. You need proof of my honest intentions. In my experience, the surest way to a woman's heart is with a gift. A priceless gift. I won't return to King's Landing until I have that for you. EURON turns and exits the Great Hall. INT. OLDTOWN - CITADEL LIBRARY SAMWELL TARLY places books on the shelves."

8366,5,0,TO,"OLDTOWN - CITADEL LIBRARY SAM wipes his brow. He stares at the gate, then looks over his shoulder, then back at the gate. He walks over to the gate, takes hold of the bars, and looks through. The gate rattles. He focuses on an open book.

8369,5,0,MARWYN,Weigh that. SAM walks over to the scales.
8370,5,0,MARWYN,The triumph of transitory pleasures. Mankind's curse. SAM puts the liver on one side of the scale and places weights on the other side.
8371,5,0,SAM,"Archmaester, I was wondering..."
8372,5,0,MARWYN,What's the weight?
8373,5,0,SAM,"Um, 147. MARWYN walks over to an open ledger, picks up a quill, and writes the number 147."
8374,5,0,SAM,I was wondering if you had considered my proposition.
8375,5,0,MARWYN,I don't remember your proposition.
8376,5,0,SAM,"I asked you if, in light of what I've seen in the North, if I could have access to the restricted area of the library."
8377,5,0,MARWYN,That area is reserved for maesters. Are you a maester?
8378,5,0,SAM,No.
8379,5,0,MARWYN,"Not a very strong proposition, is it? MARWYN hands SAM the heart. SAM takes it to the scales."
8380,5,0,SAM,"Archmaester, with respect, I've seen them--the Army of the Dead. The white walkers. W was sent here to learn how to defeat them, but everyone in the Citadel, those who will even talk to me, they all doubt the walkers ever existed in the first place."
8381,5,0,MARWYN,Everyone in the Citadel doubts everything. It's their job. But the tales of the Long Night can't be pure fabrication. Too many similarities from unconnected sources.
8382,5,0,SAM,Sources in the restricted area?
8383,5,0,MARWYN,The very same. And the simplest explanation for your grating obsession with the white walkers is that you're telling the truth and that you saw what you say you saw.
8384,5,0,SAM,"So, you believe me."
8385,5,0,MARWYN,I do. You'll finish weighing that heart?
8386,5,0,SAM,That makes you the only person south of the Twins who does.
8387,5,0,MARWYN,"We're not lie the people south of the Twins. And we're not like the people north of the Twins. In the Citadel, we lead different lives for different reasons. We are this world's memory, Samwell Tarly. Without us, men would be little better than dogs. Don't remember any meal but the last, can't see forward to any but the next. And every time you leave the house and shut the door, they howl like you're gone forever. When Robert's Rebellion was raging, people that the end was near. The end of the Targaryen dynasty. ""How will we survive?"" When Aegon Targaryen turned his eye westward and flew his dragons to Blackwater Rush--""The end is near! How will we survive?"" And thousands of year before that, during the Long Night, we can forgive them for thinking it truly was the end. But it wasn't. None of it was. The Wall has stood through it all. And every winter that ever came has ended. MARWYN closes the ledger."

8389,5,0,TO,OLDTOWN - CITADEL BEDROOM SAM rolls in a cart of clean bedpans. He walks over to a sleeping maester and grabs a ring of keys fro his bedside table.
8390,5,0,TO,"OLDTOWN - CITADEL LIBRARY SAM opens the gate, steps through, and closes it behind him. He grabs several books and stuffs them in a satchel. EXT. WINTERFELL - COURTYARD BRIENNE and PODRIC are sparring. POD missteps and BRIENNE hits him on the back with her sword. He grunts."
8391,5,0,BRIENNE,Nope. They reset. POD advances and they exchange several sword blows but POD missteps again and BRIENNE tags him on the behind. POD grunts.
8392,5,0,BRIENNE,Nope. TORMUND approaches and stares at BRIENNE. BRIENNE looks at him. POD catches her off guard and tags her shoulder with his blade. She punches him in his gut and tosses him in the snow. TORMUND looks at POD.
8393,5,0,TORMUND,"You're a lucky man. PETYR BAELISH and SANSA stand on a walkway above the courtyard, watching BRIENNE and POD."
8394,5,0,PETYR,I've heard she beat the Hound in single combat. She's a very impressive woman.
8395,5,0,SANSA,"What do you want, Lord Baelish?"
8396,5,0,PETYR,I want you to be happy. I want you to be safe.
8397,5,0,SANSA,"I am safe. I'm at home, surrounded by friends. I have Brienne to protect me from anyone who would harm me."
8398,5,0,PETYR,What about happy? Why aren't you happy? What do you want that you do not have?
8399,5,0,SANSA,"At the moment, peace and quiet. BRIENNE walks up the stairs. PETYR motions to speak."
8400,5,0,SANSA,"No need to seize the last word, Lord Baelish. I'll assume it was something clever. PETYR looks at BRIENNE."
8401,5,0,PETYR,My lady. PETYR looks at SANSA.
8402,5,0,PETYR,My lady. PETYR walks down the steps and into the courtyard.
8403,5,0,BRIENNE,Why is he still here? SANSA sighs.
8404,5,0,SANSA,"We need his men. Without the Vale, Ramsay Bolton would still hold this castle. Littlefinger saved us. BRIENNE nods and watches PETYR walk across the courtyard."
8405,5,0,BRIENNE,He wants something.
8406,5,0,SANSA,I know exactly what he wants. EXT. RIVERLANDS - FOREST ARYA is riding a horse through the forest. She happens upon a group of Lannister soldiers sitting by a fire. MAN (singing): He rode through the streets of the city / Down from his hill on high / O'er the winds and the steps and the cobble / He rode to a woman's sigh / For she was his secret treasure / She was his shame and his bliss / And a chain and a keep are nothing / Compared to a woman's kiss / For hands of gold are always cold / But a woman's hands are warm / For hands of gold are always cold / But a woman's hands are-- ARYA's horse neighs. The men turn to look at her. One stands.
8407,5,0,ARYA,That's a pretty song. I've never heard it before.
8408,5,0,MAN,It's a new one. MAN #2: Are you hungry? We've got some rabbit.
8409,5,0,ARYA,"I don't want to steal your food. MAN #3: You're not stealing, we're offering. Come on, it's gonna be a cold night. ARYA dismounts her horse, leads it nearer to the fire, and ties it reigns off on a tree. She approaches the camp. MAN #3: You heading south?"
8410,5,0,ARYA,King's Landing. MAN #2: Poor girl. The men chuckle.
8411,5,0,ARYA,"Not so bad, is it? MAN #3: Depends on your taste, I guess. If you like your streets covered in shit and pig's blood, it's the town for you. The men chuckle. MAN #2: All my life, I wanted to see the Red Keep, the Sept of Baelor, the Dragonpit. Then when I finally make it, they wouldn't let me within a mile of the Red Keep, the Sept of Baelor's blown to hell, and the Dragonpit is a damn ruin. MAN #3: The people who live there, they'd skin you alive if they could make two coppers off your hide."
8412,5,0,MAN,Worst place in the world.
8413,5,0,ARYA,"What are you doing in the Riverlands? MAN #3: There's been some trouble with the Freys up at The Twins, so we're part of the army that's been sent to keep the peace. MAN #2: Here you go. Guests first. MAN #2 passes ARYA a cooked rabbit."
8414,5,0,ARYA,"Oh, no, I couldn't. You don't have enough. MAN #2: My mother always told me to be kind to strangers. Strangers will be kind to you. ARYA pulls some meat of the rabbit's bone and eats it."
8415,5,0,ARYA,"You're a long way from home. I'm sure you've had some adventures, though. MAN #2: Yeah, endless adventures. They'll be singing about us for a thousand years. The men laugh. MAN #3; The truth is when we left home, we couldn't wait to get away. But now we've been gone a while, we can't wait to get home. MAN #2: I just think about my dad out there on his boat all alone. I ought o be out there with him. MAN #3: My wife's just had our first baby."
8416,5,0,ARYA,"Boy or girl? MAN #3: Oh, who knows? You think soldiers get ravens with news from home? The men laugh. MAN #3: I hope it's a girl."
8417,5,0,ARYA,Why? MAN #3: Girls take care of their papas when their papas grow old. Boys just go off to fight in someone else's wars. MAN #2: Are you old enough to drink? ARYA nods. MAN #2 passes a skin of wine to ARYA. She uncorks it and drinks. MAN #2: It's blackberry wine. I made it myself.
8418,5,0,ARYA,"It's really good. MAN #3: So, why is a nice girl on her own heading to King's Landing? ARYA drinks."
8419,5,0,ARYA,"I'm going to kill the queen. The men fall silent, then everyone laughs."
8420,5,0,TO,"RIVERLANDS - FARM The farm is covered in snow and the wind howls. SANDOR CLEGANE, THOROS OF MYR, BERIC DONDARRION, and several other members of the Brotherhood Without Banners ride into view."
8421,5,0,THOROS,Bad night to be outdoors.
8422,5,0,SANDOR,"You've got real powerful magic to figure that out. Did the Lord of Light whisper that in your ear? ""It's snowing, Thoros. It's windy. It's gonna be a cold night."""
8423,5,0,THOROS,"You're a grouchy old bear, aren't you, Clegane? You want some rum? THOROS holds out a skin of rum to SANDOR."
8424,5,0,SANDOR,Don't like that shit. It's too sweet.
8425,5,0,THOROS,Why are you always in such a foul mood?
8426,5,0,SANDOR,Experience. The horses all stop.
8427,5,0,BERIC,This seems like a good place to spend the night. They all stare at a nearby farmhouse.
8428,5,0,SANDOR,These people don't want us here.
8429,5,0,BERIC,Seems deserted to me. No livestock. No smoke coming from the chimney. BERIC urges his horse onward. The others follow.
8430,5,0,SANDOR,I don't like the look of it. THOROS dismounts his horse.
8431,5,0,THOROS,"For a big, hard man, you scare easy."
8432,5,0,SANDOR,I'll tell you what doesn't scare me--bald cocksuckers like you. You think you're fooling anyone with that top knot? Bald cunt. THOROS smiles.
8433,5,0,THOROS,Come on. Maybe they've got some ale hidden away.
8434,5,0,SANDOR,They don't.
8435,5,0,TO,"RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (DAY) Some of the Brothers enter the farmhouse, followed by THOROS."
8436,5,0,THOROS,"See if there's a larder. They always leave something behind. The Brothers rummage around the farmhouse. SANDOR enters. He stares at two skeletons in the corner, one adult-sized and the other child-sized. BERIC enters, sees the skeletons, and walks up beside SANDOR."
8437,5,0,BERIC,How do you think it ended for them?
8438,5,0,SANDOR,With death.
8439,5,0,BERIC,"Girl died in her father's arms. Both of them covered in blood and a knife at their feet. I'd say they were starving. And rather than letting his little girl suffer, he ended it for both of them."
8440,5,0,SANDOR,Doesn't matter now.
8441,5,0,BERIC,"No, doesn't matter now. SANDOR sits at the table. BERIC joins him. SANDOR bites into a hunk of bread. THOROS stares a fire in the fireplace."
8442,5,0,SANDOR,"I've known you a long time, Dondarrion."
8443,5,0,BERIC,Aye. I think the first time we met was at that tournament--
8444,5,0,SANDOR,And I always thought you were dull as dirt. BERIC chuckles.
8445,5,0,SANDOR,"You're not bad. I don't hate you. Don't like, but you're not bad."
8446,5,0,BERIC,"Thank you, Clegane. That warms the heart."
8447,5,0,SANDOR,But there's nothing special about you.
8448,5,0,BERIC,You're right about that.
8449,5,0,SANDOR,"So why does the Lord of Light keep bringing you back? I've met better men than you, and they've been hanged from crossbeams, or beheaded, or just shat themselves to death in a field somewhere. None of them came back. So, why you?"
8450,5,0,BERIC,You think I don't ask myself that? Every hour of every day? Why am I here? What am I supposed to do? What does the Lord see in me?
8451,5,0,SANDOR,And?
8452,5,0,BERIC,I don't know. I don't understand our Lord.
8453,5,0,SANDOR,Your Lord.
8454,5,0,BERIC,I don't know what He wants from me. I only know that He wants me alive.
8455,5,0,SANDOR,"If he's so all-powerful, why doesn't he just tell you what the fuck he wants?"
8456,5,0,THOROS,"Clegane. SANDOR looks at THOROS, who is kneeling by the fire."
8457,5,0,THOROS,Come over here. Don't worry. The fire won't bite. I want to show you something.
8458,5,0,SANDOR,It's my fucking luck I end up with a band of fire worshippers.
8459,5,0,BERIC,Aye. Almost seems like divine justice.
8460,5,0,SANDOR,"There's no divine justice, you dumb cunt. If there was, you'd be dead...and that girl would be alive. SANDOR stands and walks closer to the fire."
8461,5,0,SANDOR,What do you want?
8462,5,0,THOROS,Look into the flames.
8463,5,0,SANDOR,I don't want to look in the damn flames.
8464,5,0,THOROS,You saw me bring him back from the dead after you cut him down. Don't you want to know what gave me the power?
8465,5,0,SANDOR,I keep asking and no one wants to tell me.
8466,5,0,THOROS,We can't tell you. Only the fire can tell you. SANDOR approaches the fire and looks into it.
8467,5,0,THOROS,What do you see?
8468,5,0,SANDOR,Logs burning.
8469,5,0,THOROS,Keep looking. What do you see? SANDOR's face twists.
8470,5,0,SANDOR,Ice. A wall of ice. The Wall.
8471,5,0,THOROS,What else?
8472,5,0,SANDOR,It's where the Wall meets the sea. There's a castle there. The fire crackles.
8473,5,0,SANDOR,There's a mountain. Looks like an arrowhead. The dead are marching past. BERIC stands and approaches the fire.
8474,5,0,SANDOR,Thousands of them.
8475,5,0,BERIC,"Do you believe me now, Clegane? Do you believe we're here for a reason?"
8476,5,0,TO,RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE (NIGHT) Thoros wakes to the sound of shoveling. He picks up his sword and a lantern and exits the farmhouse. SANDOR is outside digging a grave.
8477,5,0,THOROS,"What the hell are you doing, Clegane? SANDOR plants his shovel in the ground."
8478,5,0,SANDOR,"Burying the dead. SANDOR walks over to the body of the child, lifts it up, kneels down, and places it in the hole."
8479,5,0,THOROS,You knew these people.
8480,5,0,SANDOR,"Not really. SANDOR stands, walks over to the body of the adult, lifts it up, kneels down, and places it in the hole. Then he stands and starts shoveling dirt into the hole. THOROS plants his sword in the ground and puts down his lantern, then picks up a shovel and begins helping SANDOR bury the bodies. When they're finished, they stand over the grave."
8481,5,0,SANDOR,"We ask the Father to judge us with mercy. We ask the Mother to... Fuck it, I don't remember the rest. I'm sorry you're dead. You deserved better. Both of you. SANDOR tosses down his shovel and exits. THOROS watches him leave. INT. OLDTOWN - HOUSE SAM is sitting at the table, reading. GILLY is in the corner with LITTLE SAM. She holds a doll up to him. He reacts and she laughs."
8482,5,0,SAM,Mom. GILLY turns to SAM.
8483,5,0,GILLY,"You should really sleep, Sam."
8484,5,0,SAM,"The dead don't. GILLY stands, carries a book over to the table, and sits."

8486,5,0,SAM,The Targaryens used dragonglass to decorate their weapons without even knowing what the First Men used it for. SAM sighs and turns the page. There is a diagram of a knife on the page. He turns the page again. There is a map on the page. SAM looks more closely at the map.
8487,5,0,GILLY,What is it?
8488,5,0,SAM,It's a map of Dragonstone. The Targaryens built their first stronghold there when they invaded Westeros. SAM points to a section of the map depicting a cave surrounded by a black mass.
8489,5,0,GILLY,That's dragonglass?
8490,5,0,SAM,"A mountain of it. Beneath the ground. Stannis told me, but I didn't think... This is important. Jon needs to know. SAM grabs a quill and begins writing."
8491,5,0,TO,"OLDTOWN - CITADEL QUARANTINE CELLS SAM wheels a cart along the hall. He removes a bowl from a folded-out plank in the door beside him and folds the plank back up. He puts the bowl on the cart and pushes it further down the hall. He approaches the next door, picks up the bowl, and folds in the plank. A man can be heard vomiting and coughing inside. SAM puts the bowl on the cart and pushes it further down the hall. He approaches the next door and reaches for the bowl, but a hand lurches out from the hole in the door and grabs the bowl. SAM jumps backwards and gasps. The arm of the person behind the door is covered in grayscale, revealing it belongs to JORAH MORMONT. JORAH drops the bowl on the floor."
8492,5,0,JORAH,Has she come yet?
8493,5,0,SAM,Who?
8494,5,0,JORAH,The Dragon Queen. Daenerys Stormborn.

A number of ships are anchored in the water behind them. DROGON, RHAEGAL, and VISERION fly overhead."
8496,5,0,TO,"DRAGONSTONE - BEACH Everyone gets out of the rowboat. DAENERYS walks on ahead. She kneels down and presses her palm to the sand, then stares up at the castle and walks further down the beach. The others follow. They climb the steps and approach a gate flanked by two statues of dragon heads. Two Unsullied approach the gate and push it open, revealing a walkway up to the castle. DAENERYS, TYRION, MISSANDEI, GREY WORM, and VARYS walk through the gates and up the walkway. They enter the foyer. A tapestry bearing the stag sigil of House Baratheon is hanging off to the side. DAENERYS approaches it and tears it down. DAENERYS approaches a set of doors. Two Unsullied open them for her. She enters the throne room, followed by the others. VARYS and MISSANDEI stop following her. GREY WORM starts to continue onward but MISSANDEI puts her hand on his chest to stop him. DAENERYS approaches the throne and stares at it. TYRION looks around the hall. DAENERYS ascends the steps but walks past the throne into the Chamber of the Painted Table. TYRION follows. DAENERYS walks alongside the table and runs her fingers across it. TYRION walks alongside the table opposite her and stares at the dragon carvings on the wall. DAENERYS stands at the head of the table and stares down at the map of Westeros. TYRION looks at her."

DAENERYS TARGARYEN, TYRION LANNISTER, GREY WORM, MISSANDEI, and VARYS are standing in the Chamber of the Painted Table, staring out at the storm."
8498,5,1,TYRION,"On a night like this, you came into the world."
8499,5,1,VARYS,I remember that storm. All the dogs in King's Landing howled through the night.
8500,5,1,DAENERYS,I wish I could remember it. DAENERYS turns away from the window and walks over to the table.
8501,5,1,DAENERYS,I always thought this would be a homecoming. It doesn't feel like home.
8502,5,1,TYRION,We won't stay on Dragonstone for long.
8503,5,1,DAENERYS,Good. DAENERYS looks at the figurines placed on the table
8504,5,1,DAENERYS,Not so many lions.
8505,5,1,VARYS,"Cersei controls fewer than half the Seven Kingdoms. The lord of Westeros despise her. Even before your arrival, they plotted against her. Now..."
8506,5,1,DAENERYS,They cry out for their true queen? They drink secret toasts to my health? DAENERYS walks closer to VARYS.
8507,5,1,DAENERYS,"People used to tell my brother that sort of thing, and he was stupid enough to believe them. DAENERYS picks up a dragon figurine from the table."
8508,5,1,DAENERYS,"If Viserys had three dragons and an army at his back, he'd have invaded King's Landing already."
8509,5,1,TYRION,Conquering Westeros would be easy for you. But you're not here to be queen of the ashes.
8510,5,1,DAENERYS,No. DAENERYS puts down the dragon figurine.
8511,5,1,TYRION,"We can take the Seven Kingdoms without turning it into a slaughterhouse. If the great houses support your claim against Cersei, the game is won. With the Tyrell army and the Dornish on our side, we have powerful allies in the south. DAENERYS looks at VARYS."
8512,5,1,DAENERYS,I never properly thanked you for that.
8513,5,1,VARYS,"They joined our side, my queen, because they believe in you."
8514,5,1,DAENERYS,"You served my father, didn't you, Lord Varys?"
8515,5,1,VARYS,I did.
8516,5,1,DAENERYS,And then you served the man who overthrew him?
8517,5,1,VARYS,"I had a choice, Your Grace--serve Robert Baratheon or face the headman's axe."
8518,5,1,DAENERYS,But you didn't serve him long. You turned against him.
8519,5,1,VARYS,"Robert was an improvement on your father, to be sure. There have been few rulers in history as cruel as the Mad King. Robert was neither mad nor cruel. He simply had no interest in being king."
8520,5,1,DAENERYS,So you took it upon yourself to find a better one.
8521,5,1,TYRION,"Your Grace, when I was ready to drink myself into a small coffin, Lord Varys told me about a queen in the east who-- DAENERYS (to VARYS): Before I came to power, you favored my brother. All your spies, your little birds, did they tell you Viserys was cruel, stupid, and weak? Would those qualities have made for a good king in your learned opinion?"
8522,5,1,VARYS,"Until your marriage to Khal Drogo, Your Grace, I knew nothing about you, save your existence and that you were said to be beautiful."
8523,5,1,DAENERYS,So you and your friends traded me like a prized horse to the Dothraki.
8524,5,1,VARYS,Which you turned to your advantage.
8525,5,1,DAENERYS,Who gave the order to kill me?
8526,5,1,VARYS,King Robert.
8527,5,1,DAENERYS,Who hired the assassins? DAENERYS walks closer to VARYS.
8528,5,1,DAENERYS,Who sent word to Essos to murder Daenerys Targaryen?
8529,5,1,VARYS,"Your Grace, I did what had to be done to--"
8530,5,1,DAENERYS,To keep yourself alive.
8531,5,1,TYRION,Lord Varys has proven himself a loyal servant.
8532,5,1,DAENERYS,"Proven himself loyal? Quite the opposite. If he dislikes one monarch, he conspires to crown the next one. What king of a servant is that?"
8533,5,1,VARYS,"The kind the realm needs. Incompetence should not be rewarded with blind loyalty. As long as I have my eyes, I'll use them. I wasn't born into a great house. I came from nothing. I was sold as a slave and carved up as an offering. When I was a child, I lived in alleys, gutters, abandoned houses. You wish to know where my true loyalties lie? Not with any king or queen, but with the people. The people who suffer under despots and prosper under just rule. The people whose hearts you aim to win. If you demand blind allegiance, I respect your wishes. Grey Worm can behead me or your dragons can devour me. But if you let me live, I will serve you well. I will dedicate myself to seeing you on the Iron Throne because I choose you. Because I know the people have no better chance than you."
8534,5,1,DAENERYS,"Swear this to me, Varys. If you ever think I'm failing the people, you won't conspire behind my back. You'll look me in the eye as you have done today, and you'll tell me how I'm failing them."
8535,5,1,VARYS,"I swear it, my queen."
8536,5,1,DAENERYS,"And I swear this--if you ever betray me, I'll burn you alive. VARYS smiles."
8537,5,1,VARYS,I would expect nothing less from the Mother of Dragons.
8538,5,1,WORM,"Forgive me, my queen. A red priestess from As'shai has come to see you."
8539,5,1,TO,"DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM MELISANDRE is standing alone in the throne room. DAENERYS enters, accompanied by TYRION, VARYS, MISSANDEI, and GREY WORM. They approach MELISANDRE. MELISANDRE begins speaking Valyrian."
8540,5,1,MELISANDRE,"Queen Daeneys, I was a slave once, bought and sold, scourged and branded.  It is an honor to meet the Breaker of Chains."
8541,5,1,DAENERYS,The Red Priests helped bring peace to Meereen.  You are very welcome here.  What is your name?
8542,5,1,MELISANDRE,I am called Melisandre. VARYS begins speaking English.
8543,5,1,VARYS,"She once served another who wanted the Iron Throne.  It didn't end well for Stannis Baratheon, did it?"
8544,5,1,MELISANDRE,"No, it didn't."
8545,5,1,DAENERYS,You chose an auspicious day to arrive at Dragonstone. DAENERYS turns to look at Varys.
8546,5,1,DAENERYS,We've just decided to pardon those who served the wrong king. VARYS bows his head to DAENERYS.  DAENERYS turns back to MELISANDRE.
8547,5,1,DAENERYS,"The Lord of Light doesn't have  many followers in Westeros, does he?"
8548,5,1,MELISDANDRE,Not yet.   But even those who don't worship the Lord can serve his cause.
8549,5,1,DAENERYS,What does your Lord expect from me? MELISANDRE begins speaking Valyrian again.
8550,5,1,MELISANDRE,The Long Night is coming.  Only the prince who was promised can bring the dawn. DAENERYS speaking in English.
8551,5,1,DAENERYS,The prince who was promised will bring the dawn.  I'm afraid I'm not a prince.
8552,5,1,MISSANDEI,"Your Grace, forgive me, but your translation is not quite accurate.  That noun has no gender in High Valyrian, so the proper translation for that prophecy would be the prince or princess who was promised will bring the dawn."
8553,5,1,TYRION,"Doesn't really roll off the tongue, does it?"
8554,5,1,DAENERYS,"No, but I like it better. DAENERYS turns back to MELISANDRE."
8555,5,1,DAENERYS,And you believe this prophecy refers to me?
8556,5,1,MELISANDRE,"Prophecies are dangerous things.  I believe you have a roll to play, as does another.  The King in the North, Jon Snow."
8557,5,1,TYRION,Jon Snow?  Ned Stark's bastard?
8558,5,1,DAENERYS,You know him?
8559,5,1,TYRION,I traveled with him to the Wall when he joined the Night's Watch.
8560,5,1,VARYS,"And why do you think the Lord of Light singled out this Jon Snow aside from the visions you've seen in the flames, that is?"
8561,5,1,MELISANDRE,As Lord Commander of the Night's Watch he allowed the Wildlings south of the Wall to protect them from great danger.  As King in the North he has united those Wildlings with the northern houses so together they may face their common enemy.
8562,5,1,DAENERYS,He sounds like quite a man.
8563,5,1,MELISANDRE,"Summon Jon Snow.  Let him stand before you and tell you things that have happened to him, the things that he has seen with his own eyes."
8564,5,1,TYRION,"I can't speak to prophecies or visions in the flames, but I like Jon Snow and I trusted him, and I am an excellent judge of character. DARNERYS smiles at Tyrion."
8565,5,1,TYRION,"If he does rule the north, he would make a valuable ally.  The Lannisters executed his father and conspired to murder his brother.  Jon Snow has even more reason to hate Cersei than you do. DAENERYS pauses for a moment."
8566,5,1,DAENERYS,Very well.  Send a raven north.  Tell Jon Snow that his Queen invites him to come to Drangonstone...and bend the knee.
8567,5,1,TO,"WINTERFELL - COURTYARD Young boys and girls are practicing archery.  JON, SANSA and DAVOS stand on the upper level watching the training."
8568,5,1,SANSA,Do you think it's really Tyrion?  It could be someone trying to lure you into a trap.
8569,5,1,JON,Read the last bit.
8570,5,1,SANSA,"""All dwarfs are bastards in their father's eyes.""  What does that mean?"
8571,5,1,JON,It's something he said to me the first night we met.  You know him better than any of us.  What do you think?
8572,5,1,SANSA,"Tyrion is not like the other Lannisters.  He was always kind to me, but it's too great a risk.  ""The Seven Kingdoms will bleed as long as Cersei sits on the Iron Throne.  Join us.  Together we can end her tyranny."""
8573,5,1,DAVOS,"Sounds like a charmer.  Of course, the casual mention of a Dothraki horde, a legion of Unsullied and three dragons, a bit less charming. DAVOS pauses to ponder something."
8574,5,1,JON,What?
8575,5,1,DAVOS,"Fire kills Whites, you told me.  What breathes fire?"
8576,5,1,SANSA,You're not suggesting Jon meet with her?
8577,5,1,DAVOS,"No, too dangerous."
8578,5,1,JON,But?
8579,5,1,DAVOS,"But if the Army of the Dead makes it passed the Wall, do we have enough men to fight them? JON gazes back to the courtyard looking concerned."
8580,5,1,TO,"RED KEEP - THRONEROOM CERSEI sits on the Iron Throne.  She is surrounded by JAIME, QYBURN, THE MOUNTAIN and members of her Queensguard.  Many lords are in attendance including RANDYLL TARLEY."
8581,5,1,CERSEI,"If the Mad King's daughter takes the Iron Throne, she will destroy the Realm as we know it.  Some of you are bannermen of House Tyrell.  But House Tyrell is in open rebellion against the Crown.  With their help the Mad King's daughter has ferried an army of savages to our shores.  Mindless Unsullied soldiers who will destroy your castles and your holdfasts.  Dothraki heathens who will burn your villages to the ground, rape and enslave your women, and butcher your children without a second thought.  This is how Olenna Tyrell rewards centuries of service and loyalty. The lords begin murmuring amongst themselves."
8582,5,1,CERSEI,"You all remember the Mad King.  You remember the horrors he inflicted upon his people.  His daughter is no different.  In Essos her brutality is already legendary.  She crucified hundreds of noblemen in Slaver's Bay.  And when she grew bored of that, she fed them to her dragons. The lords murmur louder"
8583,5,1,CERSEI,"It is my solemn duty to protect the people, and I will but I need your help, My Lords.  We must stand together, all of us, if we hope to stop her. RANDYLL TARLEY slowly approaches the throne."
8584,5,1,RANDYLL,"She has three full-grown dragons, Your Grace.  The same as Aegon when he conquered the Seven Kingdoms.  How do you propose to stop them? CERSEI glances over to QYBURN."
8585,5,1,QYBURN,"We are currently at work on a solution, My Lord. The meeting disbands.  All the lords walk out into the hall outside of the throne room.  JAIME approaches RANDYLL TARLEY and begins to walk with him."
8586,5,1,JAIME,Lord Tarley.
8587,5,1,RANDYLL,"Ser, Jaime.  I believe you know my son."
8588,5,1,DICKON,"Ser, Jaime."
8589,5,1,JAIME,"Rickon, isn't it?"
8590,5,1,DICKON,Dickon.
8591,5,1,JAIME,That's it. JAIME walks past Dickon and begins a discussion with Randyll
8592,5,1,JAIME,Thank you for coming.  The other lords of the Reach look to you for guidance now more than ever.  They might not have come if you hadn't.
8593,5,1,RANDYLL,"If my queen summons me, I answer the call.  And I've heard what she does to those that defy her. JAIME and RANDYLL walk to an unoccupied hallway and continue their conversation."
8594,5,1,JAIME,Do you ride for Hornhill today?
8595,5,1,RANDYLL,I have an army to mobilize.  It won't be long until the fighting starts.
8596,5,1,JAIME,And what side will you be fighting for?  You were the only man to defeat Robert Baratheon in battle.  Not even Rhaegar Targaryen could --
8597,5,1,RANDYLL,"It's a long ride back to the reach, Ser Jaime.  How may I serve?"
8598,5,1,JAIME,I want you to be my ranking general in the wars to come.  I want you to swear allegiance to Cersei and I want you to help her destroy her enemies.  All of her enemies.
8599,5,1,RANDYLL,Including Olenna Tyrell?  I'm a Tarley.  That name means something.  We're not oath breakers.  We're not schemers.  We don't stab our rivals in the back or cut their throats at weddings.   I swore an oath to House Tyrell.
8600,5,1,JAIME,"You swore an oath to the Crown as well, Lord Tarley."
8601,5,1,RANDYLL,I've known Olenna since I was a child.
8602,5,1,JAIME,"She was a great woman, once.  Now she's broken.  She wants revenge so badly she brought the Dothraki to our shores.  The Dothraki in Westeros for the first time in history.  I know you don't like my sister, but you have to make a choice.  Do you fight with us or with the foreign savages and eunuchs? RANDYLL nods his head in agreement"
8603,5,1,JAIME,When the war is won the queen will need a new warden of the south.  I can think of no better man than Randyll Tarley.
8604,5,1,TO,"CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS ARCHMAESTER MARWYN, SAMWELL and JORAH are standing together in the quarantine room.  JORAH's upper body is covered in Greyscale except his face."
8605,5,1,MARWYN,The infection has spread too far.  You should have cut off your arm the moment you were touched.
8606,5,1,JORAH,How long?
8607,5,1,MARWYN,"It will be years before it kills you.  It could be 10, could be 20."
8608,5,1,JORAH,But how long 'till...
8609,5,1,MARWYN,"Your mind?  Six months, maybe fewer. JORAH sighs and sits down on his bed.  SAMWELL approaches MARWYN."
8610,5,1,SAMWELL,"Pardon, Archmaester.  I met Stannis Baratheon's daughter at Castle Black.  She had Greyscale as a baby and was cured.  Isn't there some way --"
8611,5,1,MARWYN,Does this look like a baby to you?
8612,5,1,SAMWELL,No.
8613,5,1,MARWYN,Have you studied the varying rates of Greyscale progression in infants and fully grown men?
8614,5,1,SAMWELL,No.
8615,5,1,MARWYN,Maester Chrissen discovered Shireen Baratheon's affliction immediately. MARWYN turns to face JORAH.
8616,5,1,MARWYN,"This is quite advanced and beyond our skills, Ser.  Were you a commoner I'd have you shipped to Valyria at once to live out your life with the Stone Men.  As an anointed Knight I'll allow you one more day.  How you choose to spend that time is up to you. JORAH nods his head.  MARWYN turns to leave the room and begins walking to the door."
8617,5,1,MARWYN,"Come, Samwell."
8618,5,1,SAMWELL,"Should we send word to your family, Ser..."
8619,5,1,JORAH,Jorah.  Jorah Mormont.
8620,5,1,SAMWELL,Mormont?
8621,5,1,JORAH,There's no need.  I've been dead to them for years. MARWYN is waiting for SAMWELL in the hallway
8622,5,1,MARWYN,"Come, Samwell. SAMWELL turns and walks out of the room.  He closes the door to the quarantine room."
8623,5,1,TO,UNDER THE RED KEEP - DUNGEONS QYBURN and CERSEI are walking along the torch lit dungeon passing the dragon skulls.
8624,5,1,QYBURN,"Have you ever been down here, Your Grace?"
8625,5,1,CERSEI,"No, I can't say I have.  I haven't seen these since Robert had them removed from the Throne Room."
8626,5,1,QYBURN,Curious that King Robert did not have them destroyed.
8627,5,1,CERSEI,They were his trophies.  He couldn't keep them around.  They would have made him look small.  Sometimes he would come down here and look at them.  I believe he brought his whores on occasion. QYBURN and CERSEI arrive at the end of the dungeon.  They are looking at the largest dragon skull in the room.
8628,5,1,QYBURN,"Balerion the Dread.  The beast that Aegon rode across the sea.  Its flames forged the Iron Throne and brought the Seven Kingdoms to heel.  Powerful, but not invincible. QYBURN turns and starts walking away from the dragon skull."
8629,5,1,QYBURN,"Apparently one of Daenarys' dragons was wounded by spears in the fighting pits of Meereen.  If they can be wounded, they can be killed. QYBURN walks up to a machine covered by a cloth.  He reaches up and removes the cloth revealing an artillery-sized crossbow aimed at Balerion's skull."
8630,5,1,QYBURN,"The finest artilleters and blacksmiths in King's Landing have been laboring day and night, Your Grace.  If you'd kindly pull that lever. CERSEI releases a lever on the machine and launches a giant bolt directly into Balerion's eye socket.  The bolt buries deep into the skull and gets stuck.  CERSEI stands behind the machine smirking."
8631,5,1,TO,"DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE DAENERYS, YARA GREYJOY, THEON GREYJOY, ELLARIA SAND, OLENNA TYRELL, VARYS, GREY WORM, MISSANDEI, and TYRION LANNISTER are standing around a carved table of Westeros having a discussion."
8632,5,1,YARA,"If you want the Iron Throne, take it.  We have an army, a fleet, and three dragons.  We should hit King's Landing now.  Hard.  With everything we have.  The city will fall within a day."
8633,5,1,TYRION,"If we turn the dragons loose, tens of thousands will die in the firestorms. ELLARIA looks at TYRION with disgust."
8634,5,1,ELLARIA,"It's called war.  You don't have the stomach for it, scurry back into hiding."
8635,5,1,TYRION,I know how you wage war.  We don't poison little girls here.  Myrcella was innocent.
8636,5,1,ELLARIA,She was a Lannister.  There are no innocent Lannisters.  My greatest regret is that Oberyn died fighting for you.
8637,5,1,DAENERYS,That's enough.  Tyrion is the Hand of the Queen.  You will treat him with respect. DAENERYS pauses for a moment.
8638,5,1,DAENERYS,I am not here to be queen of the ashes. OLENNA addresses DAENERYS from across the table.
8639,5,1,OLENNA,"That's very nice to hear.  Of course, I can't remember a queen who was better loved than my grand daughter.  The common people loved her, the nobles loved her.  And what is left of her now?  Ashes.  Commoners, nobles, they're all just children really.  They won't obey you unless they fear you."
8640,5,1,DAENERYS,"I'm grateful to you, Lady Olenna, for your council.  I'm grateful to all of you.  But you have chosen to follow me.  I will not attack King's Landing.  We will not attack King's Landing."
8641,5,1,OLEANNA,Then how do you mean to take the Iron Throne?  By asking nicely?
8642,5,1,DAENERYS,We will lay siege to the capital surrounding the city on all sides.  Cersei will have the Iron Throne but no food for her army or the people.
8643,5,1,TYRION,But we won't use Dothraki and Unsullied. TYRION begins walking around the carved table of Westeros.
8644,5,1,TYRION,"Cersei will try to rally the lords of Westeros by appealing to their loyalty, their love for their country.  If we besiege the city with foreigners, we prove her point.  Our army should be Westerosi."
8645,5,1,ELLIA,And I suppose we're providing the Westerosi?
8646,5,1,TYRION,You are. TYRION reaches down and picks up a figurine that resembles a Kraken in a longship.
8647,5,1,TYRION,Lady Greyjoy will escort you home to Sunspear and her Iron Fleet will ferry the Dornish army back up to King's Landing. TYRION walks to the south of the map and picks up a figurine that resembles a sun.  He takes both figurines and places them at King's Landing.
8648,5,1,TYRION,The Dornish will lay siege to the capital alongside the Tyrell army.  Two great kingdoms united against Cersei.
8649,5,1,OLENNA,"So, your master plan is to use our armies?  Forgive me for asking, but why did you bother to bring your own? TYRION reaches down and picks up the figurine resembling an Unsullied helmet.  He begins walking back around the map of Westeros."
8650,5,1,TYRION,The unsullied will have another objective.  For decades House Lannister has been the true power in Westeros.  And the seat of that power is Casterly Rock.  Grey Worm and the Unsullied will sail for the Rock and take it. TYRION stops in front of Casterly Rock.  There is a figurine that resembles a lion.  He knocks the lion over with the Unsullied figurine.  Everyone in the room nods in agreement.
8651,5,1,DAENERYS,Do I have your support?
8652,5,1,YARA,You have mine.
8653,5,1,ELLIA,"Dorne is with you, Your Grace. Lady Olenna nods her head in agreement."
8654,5,1,DAENERYS,"Thank you all.  Lady Olenna, may I speak with you alone? Everyone except DAENERYS and OLENNA leave the Chamber of the Painted Table.  DAENERYS walks to the end and sits next to OLENNA."
8655,5,1,DAENERYS,I realize you're here out of hatred for Cersei and not love for me.  But I swear to you she will pay for what she's done and we will bring peace back to Westeros.
8656,5,1,OLENNA,"Peace.  Do you think that's what we had under your father or his father or his?  Peace never lasts, my dear.  Would you take a bit of advice from an old woman? DAENERYS nods her hod in agreement"
8657,5,1,OLENNA,"He's a clever man, your Hand.  I've known a great many clever men.  I've outlived them all.  Do you know why?  I ignored them.  The lords of Westeros are sheep.  Are you a sheep?  No.  You're a dragon.  Be a dragon. CUT TO - DRAGONSTONE - GREY WORM'S QUARTERS GREY WORM is sitting sharpening his sword.  Someone knocks on his door.  He begins speaking Valyrian."
8658,5,1,WORM,Enter. MISSANDEI walks in.  She speaks in English.
8659,5,1,MISSANDEI,You leave tomorrow.  Were you going to say goodbye?
8660,5,1,WORM,I will see you when I return.
8661,5,1,MISSANDEI,But you don't know when that will be.
8662,5,1,GREYWORM,No one knows.
8663,5,1,MISSANDEI,I wish you good fortune. MISSANDEI turns and starts to walk out of the room.
8664,5,1,WORM,Missandei -- MISSANDEI stops and turns back towards GREY WORM.
8665,5,1,WORM,It is hard for me to say goodbye to you.
8666,5,1,MISSANDEI,Why?
8667,5,1,WORM,You know why.
8668,5,1,MISSANDEI,I don't.
8669,5,1,WORM,You are my weakness. MISSANDEI appears offended.
8670,5,1,MISSANDEI,That's what I am?  Your weakness?
8671,5,1,WORM,"When Unsullied are young their masters learn their fears.  One boy is scared of dogs.  One boy hates high places.  One is frightened of the ocean.  They make the boy sleep with dogs or climb a cliff.  They throw him in the water.  If he learns to swim, good.  If he drowns, good.  Either way, strong Unsullied.  But I had no fears.  I was never the biggest, never the strongest, but I was bravest always."
8672,5,1,MISSANDEI,I believe it.
8673,5,1,WORM,Until I meet Missandei from the Isle of Naarth.  Now I have fear.
8674,5,1,MISSANDEI,I do too. GREY WORM steps forward and kisses MISSANDEI.  MISSANDEI grabs his hands and stops him.  She begins to undress herself.  MISSANDEI steps forward and begins to undress GREY WORM.
8675,5,1,WORM,No.
8676,5,1,MISSANDEI,"I want to see you.  Please. GREY WORM hesitates for a moment, then nods his head in agreement.  MISSANDEI finishes undressing GREY WORM.  Sex scene ensues. CUT TO - CITADEL LIBRARY MARWYN and SAMWELL are walking by various shelves in the library.  SAMWELL is carrying a stack of books for MARWYN."
8677,5,1,MARWYN,It might be useful.  Fouthen was a dreadful writer but an excellent researcher.
8678,5,1,SAMWELL,"Archmaester, I wanted to --"
8679,5,1,MARWYN,And this one. MARWYN places another book on the stack SAMWELL is carrying.
8680,5,1,MARWYN,Maester Faol was quite the opposite.  A brilliant stylist who invented half the stories he tells. MARWYN continues walking
8681,5,1,SAMWELL,I wanted to ask you --
8682,5,1,MARWYN,"If you need to write histories, Tarley, you have to do the research.  If you want people to read your histories, you need a bit of style.  I'm not writing the Chronicle of the Wars Following the Death of King Robert the First so it can sit on a shelf unread. SAMWELL says nothing."
8683,5,1,MARWYN,What?  You don't like the title?  What would you call it then?
8684,5,1,SAMWELL,Possibly something a bit more poetic?
8685,5,1,MARWYN,"We're not poets, Tarley."
8686,5,1,SAMWELL,"Archmaester, if I could just have a moment."
8687,5,1,MARWYN,This is your moment.  Use it wisely. MARWYN begins looking through books on the shelf.
8688,5,1,SAMWELL,I may have found a way to treat Ser Jorah.  There are two recorded cases of advanced Greyscale being cured.  I found the procedure in the Study of Rare Diseases by Archmaester Pilos. MARWYN places a book on SAMWELL's stack.  He continues looking at more books.
8689,5,1,MARWYN,I'm familiar with Archmaester Pylos and the Study of Rare Diseases.
8690,5,1,SAMWELL,"Oh, you are?"
8691,5,1,MARWYN,Yes.  Should I tell you how he died?  From Greyscale. MARWYN places another book on SAMWELL's stack.
8692,5,1,SAMWELL,Oh.
8693,5,1,MARWYN,The procedure is far too dangerous which is why it's now forbidden. MARWYN turns and walks out of the library.
8694,5,1,TO,QUARANTINE ROOMS A few hours have passed.  JORAH is writing a letter to DAENERYS by candlelight in his quarantine room.  He hears a noise in the hallway and stands to face the door.  SAMWELL opens the door and rolls in a cart filled with medical tools and containers.
8695,5,1,SAMWELL,Hello.
8696,5,1,JORAH,What are you doing?
8697,5,1,SAMWELL,You're Jorah Mormont.  You're the only son of Jeor Mormont. SAMWELL picks up a roll of leather and sets it on the table.  He unrolls it revealing an assortment of scalpels and knives.
8698,5,1,SAMWELL,"My name is Samwell Tarley.  I'm a sworn brother of the Night's Watch training to serve as maester of Castle Black.  I knew your father.  I was with him when he died.  You're not dying today, Ser Jorah. SAMWELL picks up a large flask and hands it to JORAH."
8699,5,1,SAMWELL,Drink this.
8700,5,1,JORAH,What is it?
8701,5,1,SAMWELL,"Rum.  Drink it all, please.  I'm afraid this is going to hurt. JORAH reaches for the bottle. SAMWELL grabs it back and drinks some himself before handing it back to JORAH .  JORAH drains the flask.  SAMWELL picks up a thick book from the medical cart and sets it on the table."
8702,5,1,SAMWELL,If you could take off your shirt. SAMWELL gives JORAH a strap made of leather.
8703,5,1,SAMWELL,"If you wouldn't mind, bite down hard.  I'm sorry but no one knows I'm here.  If they hear you screaming then we're both finished."
8704,5,1,JORAH,Have you ever done this before?
8705,5,1,SAMWELL,"No.  No one else will try, so I'm the best you've got.  Have a seat.  I'm going to remove the entire layer of infected tissue, then apply a medicinal ointment to the -- JORAH looks at SAMWELL to stop him from explaining.  SAMWELL picks up a pair of tweezers and a scalpel.  He grabs a section of Greyscale to cut it off.  JORAH recoils in pain."
8706,5,1,SAMWELL,"Shh,  shhh.  Again, I'm sorry.  Please try not to scream. SAMWELL cuts into the Greyscale.  JORAH begins to writhe in agony and whimper.  Pus is dripping from the wound.  SAMWELL continues cutting and slices a layer of Greyscale off JORAH's skin."
8707,5,1,TO,"INN AT THE CROSSROADS Two men are at a table having a conversation. MAN #1:  They say her dragons are bigger than Aegons. MAN #2:  Horse shit.  Cersei is just trying to frighten us. MAN #1:  If it's true, if she lays siege to King's Landing prices will triple. The camera zooms out showing Arya eavesdropping on the men. MAN #2:  As long as we get back there before they start. MAN #1:  One more round.  It's a long ride. A waiter approaches Arya's table."
8708,5,1,PIE,Ary!
8709,5,1,ARYA,"Hello, Hot Pie.  Sit down.  Who's that for? Arya reaches over and grabs a potpie from the tray and starts eating it."
8710,5,1,ARYA,Mmm.  This is good.
8711,5,1,PIE,You think so?  The secret is browning the butter before making the dough.  Most people don't don't do that because it takes up too much time.
8712,5,1,ARYA,I didn't do that.
8713,5,1,PIE,You've been making pies?
8714,5,1,ARYA,One or two.
8715,5,1,PIE,I can't believe you're here.  Did you meet the big lady?
8716,5,1,ARYA,Big lady?
8717,5,1,PIE,The lady knight.  I figured she was a knight because she had armor on.  She was looking for your sister but I told her about you.  Did she ever find you?
8718,5,1,ARYA,She found me.
8719,5,1,PIE,What happened to you Ary? ARYA pauses and doesn't answer HOT PIE.
8720,5,1,ARYA,"You got any ale? Hot Pie starts to reach for a pitcher on the tray.  Arya reaches over and grabs it before him, pouring herself a cup."
8721,5,1,PIE,Where are you heading?
8722,5,1,ARYA,King's Landing.
8723,5,1,PIE,Why?
8724,5,1,ARYA,I heard Cersei's queen now.
8725,5,1,PIE,I heard she blew up the Great Sept.  That must have been something to see.  Boom.
8726,5,1,ARYA,Hmm. Arya nods in agreement.
8727,5,1,PIE,I can't believe someone could do that.
8728,5,1,ARYA,Cersei would do that.
8729,5,1,PIE,I thought you'd be heading for Winterfell.
8730,5,1,ARYA,Why would I go there?  The Boltons have it.
8731,5,1,PIE,No.  The Boltons are dead. Arya stops eating and drops her food.
8732,5,1,ARYA,What?
8733,5,1,PIE,Jon Snow came down from Castle Black with a Wildling army and won the Battle of the Bastards.  He's King in the North now.
8734,5,1,ARYA,You're lying.
8735,5,1,PIE,Why would I lie about that?  He's your brother right? ARYA starts picking up her things to leave.
8736,5,1,ARYA,Thanks for the pie. Arya reaches to her side and produces a bag of gold.  She starts to open the pouch.
8737,5,1,PIE,Friends don't pay.  I can't believe I thought you were a boy.  You're pretty.
8738,5,1,ARYA,Thanks. Arya stands and walks past Hot Pie.  She turns and puts her hand on his shoulder.
8739,5,1,ARYA,"Take care of yourself, Hot Pie.  Try not to get killed."
8740,5,1,PIE,"No, I won't.  I'm like you, Ary.  I'm a survivor. ARYA turns and exits the Inn"
8741,5,1,TO,"EXT. INN AT THE CROSSROADS ARYA climbs on her horse.  She looks towards the south, then the north.  She makes a decision and turns around to head back north.  She rides off into the distance."
8742,5,1,TO,WINTERFELL - KING'S QUARTERS JON is bent over his desk looking at maps.  There's a knock at the door.
8743,5,1,JON,Come in.
8744,5,1,WOLKAN,"A raven, My King, from the Citadel. JON begins reading the scroll."
8745,5,1,TO,"WINTERFELL - GREAT HALL The room is filled with northern lords and ladies including SANSA, JON, BRIENNE, LYANNA MORMONT, ROBETT GLOVER, YOHN ROYCE, and PETER BAELISH.  JON is standing in the great hall holding a message up for the lords to see."
8746,5,1,JON,This message was sent to me by Samwell Tarley.  He was my brother at the Night's Watch.  A man I trust as much as anyone in this world.  He's discovered proof that Dragonstone sits on a mountain of Dragonglass. The lords murmur amongst themselves.  JON hands the first note to ROBETT GLOVER.  JON holds up a different note for the lords to see.
8747,5,1,JON,I received this a few days ago from Dragonstone.  It was sent to me by Tyrion Lannister. The lords murmur louder.
8748,5,1,JON,"He's now Hand of the Queen to Daenerys Targaryen.  She intends to take the Iron Throne from Cersei Lannister.  She has a powerful army at her back and if this message is to be believed, three dragons. The lords speak among themselves and look concerned."
8749,5,1,JON,Lord Tyrion has invited me to Dragonstone to meet with Daenerys and I'm going to accept. There is a negative outcry from the lords gathered in the hall
8750,5,1,JON,"We need this Dragonglass, My Lords.  We know that Dragonglass can destroy both White Walkers and their army.  We need to mine it and turn it into weapons. The lords nod in agreement"
8751,5,1,JON,"But more importantly, we need allies.  The Night King's army grows larger by the day.  We can't defeat them on our own.  We don't have the numbers.  Daenerys has her own army and she has dragon fire.  I need to try and persuade her to fight with us.  Ser Davos and I will ride for White Harbor tomorrow, then sail for Dragonstone."
8752,5,1,SANSA,Have you forgotten what happened to our grandfather?  The Mad King invited him to King's Landing and roasted him alive.
8753,5,1,JON,I know that.
8754,5,1,SANSA,"She is here to reclaim the Iron Throne and the Seven Kingdoms.  The north is one of those seven kingdoms.  This isn't an invitation, it's a trap."
8755,5,1,JON,"It could be, but I don't believe Tyrion would do that.  You know him.  He's a good man. YOHN ROYCE stands up and turns to face JON."
8756,5,1,ROYCE,"Your Grace, with respect I must agree with Lady Sansa.  I remember the Mad King all too well.  A Targaryen cannot be trusted, nor can a Lannister. The lords shout in agreement."
8757,5,1,GLOVER,"We called your brother king, and then he rode south and lost his kingdom."
8758,5,1,MORMONT,"Winter is here, Your Grace.  We need the King in the North in the north. The lords pound the tables in agreement."
8759,5,1,JON,"You all crowned me your king.  I never wanted it, I never asked for it, but I accepted it because the north is my home.  It's part of me and I will never stop fighting for it, no matter the odds.  But the odds are against us.  None of you have seen the Army of the Dead.  None of you.  We can never hope to defeat them alone.  We need allies, powerful allies.  I know it's a risk.  But I have to take it."
8760,5,1,SANSA,Then send an emissary.  Don't go yourself.
8761,5,1,JON,Daenerys is a queen.  Only a king can convince her to help us.  It has to be me.
8762,5,1,SANSA,You're abandoning your people.  Your abandoning your home.
8763,5,1,JON,I'm leaving both in good hands.
8764,5,1,SANSA,Whose?
8765,5,1,JON,"Yours.  You are my sister.  You are the only Stark in Winterfell.  Until I return, the north is yours."
8766,5,1,TO,WINTERFELL - THE CRYPT JON stands in the torchlit crypt looking at a statue of Ned Stark.  LORD BAELISH approaches him.
8767,5,1,BAELISH,I delivered his bones myself.  I presented them to Lady Catlyn as a gesture of goodwill from Tyrion Lannister.  It seems like a lifetime ago.  Do give Lord Tyrion my best when you see him. Baelish looks up at the statue of Ned Stark.
8768,5,1,BAELISH,"I was sorry when he died.  Your father and I had our differences but he loved Cat very much.  So did I.  She wasn't fond of you, was she?  Well, it appears she vastly underestimated you.  Your father and brothers are gone, yet here you stand King in the North.  Last best hope against the coming storm. JON turns to face BAELISH."
8769,5,1,JON,You don't belong down here.
8770,5,1,BAELISH,Forgive me.  We have never talked properly.  I wanted to remedy that.
8771,5,1,JON,I have nothing to say to you.
8772,5,1,BAELISH,"Not even thank you?  If it weren't for me you'd have been slaughtered at that battlefield.  You have many enemies, My King, but I swear to you I'm not one of them.  I love Sansa as I loved her mother. JON grabs BAELISH by the throat and pushes him against the wall.  BAELISH begins choking."
8773,5,1,JON,Touch my sister and I'll kill you myself. JON releases BAELISH.  JON turns and walks to exit the crypt.
8774,5,1,TO,"WINTERFELL - COURTYARD JON walks into the courtyard towards his horse.  SER DAVOS is seated on his own horse awaiting him.  JON climbs onto his horse and looks back.  He sees SANSA on the upper level of the courtyard.  JON waves goodbye and SANSA waves back.  JON, DAVOS and Winterfell guards ride out of the gate and exit the courtyard.  BAELISH exits from the crypt looking shaken."
8775,5,1,TO,RIVERLANDS ARYA is building a fire.  Her horse is tied to a tree.  The horse begins to whinny.  ARYA stands and grabs her sword from beside the fire.  Multiple wolves come from the woods and begin to circle her.  A large grey and white dire wolf approaches her barring teeth.
8776,5,1,ARYA,Nymeria? ARYA sets her sword down and begins to approach the dire wolf.
8777,5,1,ARYA,"Nymeria, it's me, Arya.  I'm heading north, girl, back to Winterfell.  I'm finally going home.  Come with me. ARYA stretches her hand out towards the dire wolf."
8778,5,1,ARYA,Come with me. The dire wolf turns and begins to leave.  All the other wolves walk away with it.  ARYA whispers to herself.
8779,5,1,ARYA,That's not you.
8780,5,1,TO,SEA OF DORNE It's nighttime.  There are dozens of ships sailing on the Sea of Dorne.
8781,5,1,TO,"SEA OF DORNE - INT. YARA'S SHIP ELLARIA SAND's daughters TYENE, OBARA, and NYMERIA are laying in hammocks next to each other having a conversation."
8782,5,1,NYMERIA,You can't have them all.  It's not fair.
8783,5,1,OBARA,I'm oldest.
8784,5,1,TYENE,Momma will want Cersei for herself.
8785,5,1,OBARA,She's not my momma.  You can have Cersei.  I want The Mountain.
8786,5,1,NYMERIA,The Mountain killed father.  He'll crush you with one hand.
8787,5,1,TYENE,Father got careless.  That's what Momma says.
8788,5,1,OBARA,"Will you shut up about Momma?  Momma, momma. OBARA begins mocking TYENE."
8789,5,1,TYENE,Maybe I'll kill you both before we take King's Landing and then I won't have to share. OBARA and NYMERIA mock TYENE in unison.
8790,5,1,TO,"SEA OF DORNE - INT. OF YARA'S SHIP - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS YARA GREYJOY, ELLARIA SAND are seated at a table drinking together.  THEON GREYJOY is standing next to them."
8791,5,1,ELLARIA,"How can you drink this piss?  When we reach Sunspear I'll treat you to a Dornish red, the best in the world.  Have you ever been to Dorne?"
8792,5,1,YARA,A few times.  Never stayed long.
8793,5,1,ELLARIA,A boy in every port?
8794,5,1,YARA,"A boy, a girl.  Depends on the port."
8795,5,1,ELLARIA,Could we get some more? ELLARIA hands her empty cup back to THEON.
8796,5,1,YARA,I thought it wasn't for you.
8797,5,1,ELLARIA,I'm developing a taste for it. YARA looks at THEON
8798,5,1,YARA,He's not your servant.
8799,5,1,THEON,It's fine. THEON begins filling the cup from a barrel of wine.
8800,5,1,ELLARIA,"So, you're going to be Queen of the Iron Islands."
8801,5,1,YARA,Once I kill my uncle.
8802,5,1,ELLARIA,"And what will you be, handsome? ELLARIA stands and gropes THEON."
8803,5,1,THEON,Whatever my queen demands.
8804,5,1,YARA,"He'll be my advisor, my protector."
8805,5,1,ELLARIA,"Oh, I see.  Your protector. ELLARIA slowly walks towards YARA."
8806,5,1,ELLARIA,So if someone gets too close to you --
8807,5,1,YARA,He might have to intervene.
8808,5,1,ELLARIA,-- hold that person back.
8809,5,1,YARA,"Until they've made their intentions known. ELLARIA sits next to YARA and spreads her legs apart, then looks at THEON."
8810,5,1,ELLARIA,Why are you standing all the way over there then?  A foreign invasion is under way.  It seems like you don't need a protector. A large crash is heard and the ship rocks back and forth.  YARA turns to ELLARIA.
8811,5,1,YARA,"Stay here. YARA stands, picks up her sword and rushes for the stairs to the upper deck.  THEON follows her."
8812,5,1,TO,SEA OF DORNE - EXT. YARA'S SHIP YARA climbs onto the deck and sees mayhem.  There are flaming arrows and flares in the sky.  YARA turns to survey the madness.  A ship bearing the Greyjoy sigil comes sailing out of the smoke and fog directly at YARA's ship.
8813,5,1,YARA,Euron. EURON'S ship crashes into YARA's.  An armored gang plank is dropped onto YARA's ship.  Euron Greyjoy is riding on top of the plank as it crashes onto YARA's ship.  A sailor is crushed in the process.  Euron boards YARA's boat and begins cutting men down with an ax and laughing maniacally.  Dozens of men are rushing behind him to board YARA'S ship.  YARA and THEON both yell and leap into battle.  Many people are killed instantly.  More men are running over the gang plank.  TYENE SAND comes from below deck.  She throws a dagger and lodges it in an invader's eye.  She moves to the body to retrieve her knife.  YARA approaches her and kneels beside her.
8814,5,1,YARA,Your mother is below deck.  Keep her safe. TYENE nods in agreement.  She stands up and heads down into the captain's quarters.
8815,5,1,TO,"SEA OF DORNE - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS TYENE walks down the stairs and sees her mother, ELLARIA SAND.  TYENE runs to her mother and hugs her.  Immediately three men climb down the stairs and surround the women.  TYENE begins striking at the invaders with her knife."
8816,5,1,TO,SEA OF DORNE - EXT. YARA'S SHIP THEON is fighting several men with his sword.  He cuts down two men and looks at YARA.  YARA looks around her at the scene.  Severel ships are engulfed in flames.  Flaming arrows are streaking in and men are shouting.  A flaming bolt flies through the air and hits YARA's mast causing it to burst into flames.  More men are rushing from EURON'S boat onto the deck.  YARA is slowly walking and watching the scene unfold.  She then turns and continues fighting.  EURON is cutting through men with ease.  He has just killed another when a whip lashes around his throat.  NYMERIA pulls on the whip and brings EURON towards her.  Euron turns and punches her in the face.  OBARA comes from behind EURON and stabs him in his arm.  He is knocked to the ground but quickly regains his feet.  They continue fighting
8817,5,1,TO,SEA OF DORNE - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS TYENE is still fighting the men.  She slices one man and stabs another in the testicles.
8818,5,1,TO,"SEA OF DORNE - EXT. YARA'S SHIP OBARA attempts to attack EURON again.  He blocks her attack and disarms her spear.  EURON grabs her by the throat and headbutts her then pushes her to her knees.  He rams her spear through her stomach and lifts her off the ground.  NYMERIA turns and sees her sister and screams, running at EURON.  She whips him several times but EURON graps the end of the whip and pulls NYMERIA towards him.  She is attacking with a knife.  EURON punches her and knocks her down.  EURON then takes NYMERIA'S whip and wraps it around her throat choking her."
8819,5,1,TO,SEA OF DORNE - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS TYENE is now getting overpowered by the men.  They punch her and grab her from behind.  One of the men walks to ELLARIA and grabs her.
8820,5,1,ELLARIA,Kill us!  Get it over with! The man in charge smirks at ELLARIA and shakes his head.  The men begin to push ELLARIA and TYENE upstairs to take them as hostages.
8821,5,1,TO,SEA OF DORNE - EXT. YARA'S SHIP Nearly every ship in YARA's fleet is burning.  There are flaming bolts in the sky.  YARA spots EURON below her.  She jumps from the upper deck and knocks EURON down.  He gets back up.
8822,5,1,EURON,Give your uncle a kiss. YARA quickly steps forward and slaps EURON.  They begin fighting.  YARA is being overpowered by EURON.
8823,5,1,EURON,Theon! THEON is still fighting.  He hears his uncle's yell and turns to look.  EURON is holding YARA and has his ax to her neck.  THEON stops and is frozen in place.  EURON begins smirking at him.
8824,5,1,EURON,"Ah, come on your cockless hound.  I have her.  Come and get her. THEON is looking around.  Men are being killed and everything is on fire.  One invader is pulling someone's teeth out. THEON begins to shake and whimper.  His eye twitches. He turns, drops his sword and jumps off of the rail of the ship into the water. EURON begins to laugh and look at YARA."
8825,5,2,DEFAULT,"The Queen's Justice (Script) Lyrics EPISODE 3 - THE QUEEN'S JUSTICE TITLE SEQUENCE EXT. DRAGONSTONE - BEACH Waves are crashing against rocks and washing over the beach.  Men are pulling JON SNOW's boat onto shore.  JON and DAVOS are walking onto the beach towards TYRION, MISSANDEI and Dothraki guards.  Dragonstone can be seen in the distance."
8826,5,2,TYRION,The bastard of Winterfell.
8827,5,2,JON,"The dwarf of Casterly Rock. TYRION and JON both stare at each for a moment, then break into a smile.  They step forward and shake hands."
8828,5,2,TYRION,I believe we last saw each other on top of the wall.
8829,5,2,JON,"You were pissing off the edge, if I remember right.  You picked up some scars along the road. TYRION nods his head in agreement."
8830,5,2,TYRION,It's been a long road.  But we're both still here. TYRION turns to address DAVOS.
8831,5,2,TYRION,I'm Tyrion Lannister.
8832,5,2,DAVOS,Davos Seaworth. TYRION and DAVOS shake hands.
8833,5,2,TYRION,"Ah, the Onion Knight.  We fought on opposite sides at the Battle of Blackwater Bay."
8834,5,2,DAVOS,Unluckily for me.
8835,5,2,TYRION,Missandei is the queen's most trusted advisor.
8836,5,2,MISSANDEI,Welcome to Dragonstone.  Our queen knows this is a long journey.  She appreciates the effort you have made on her behalf.  If you wouldn't mind handing over your weapons. JON looks at DAVOS and his men.
8837,5,2,JON,Of course. The Dothraki guard move to take the weapons.  JON unties his sword and hands it over.  The Dothraki pick up JON's boat and begin to carry it away.
8838,5,2,MISSANDEI,"Please, this way. DAVOS begins walking with MISSANDEI and TYRION.  JON is following a few steps behind."
8839,5,2,DAVOS,Where are you from?  I can't place the accent.
8840,5,2,MISSANDEI,I was born on the Island of Naarth.
8841,5,2,DAVOS,Ah.  I hear it's beautiful down there.  Palm trees and butterflies.  I haven't been myself. MISSANDEI nods and DAVOS slows pace to talk with JON.
8842,5,2,DAVOS,This place has changed.
8843,5,2,TO,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAY The group are making their way up to Dragonstone along a narrow stone pathway built into the cliffs leading to the castle.  TYRION begins speaking to JON.
8844,5,2,TYRION,"And Sansa, I hear she's alive and well."
8845,5,2,JON,She is.
8846,5,2,TYRION,Does she miss me terribly? JON looks at TYRION and doesn't say anything.
8847,5,2,TYRION,A sham marriage and unconsummated.
8848,5,2,JON,I didn't ask --
8849,5,2,TYRION,"Well, it was.  It wasn't.  Anyway, she's much smarter than she lets on."
8850,5,2,JON,She's starting to let on.
8851,5,2,TYRION,Good.  At some point I want to hear how a Knight's Watch recruit became King in the North.
8852,5,2,JON,As long as you tell me how a Lannister became Hand to Daenerys Targaryen.
8853,5,2,TYRION,"A long and bloody tale.  To be honest, I was drunk for most of it."
8854,5,2,JON,My bannermen think I'm a fool for coming here.
8855,5,2,TYRION,"Of course they do.  If I was your hand I would have advised against it.  General rule of thumb, Stark men don't fare well when they travel south."
8856,5,2,JON,"True.  But I'm not a Stark. A loud roar is heard from overhead.  JON and DAVOS dive to the ground.  Drogon flies over them, turns and flies over the castle. JON and DAVOS look at each other in astonishment.  DAVOS looks back to MISSANDEI who is still standing and smirking.  Tyrion walks over and helps JON up to his feet."
8857,5,2,TYRION,"I'd say you get used to them, but you never really do. JON looks back to the sky.  All three dragons are circling above the castle."
8858,5,2,TYRION,Come.  Their mother is waiting for you. JON and DAVOS exchange glances.  They continue walking up the path.  The camera shifts focus to MELISANDRE who is far above the group watching them from a cliff.  VARYS approaches MELISANDRE from behind and stands next to her.
8859,5,2,VARYS,I wondered why you weren't there to meet our guests.  You begged us to summon the King in the North.  Don't you want to see him again?
8860,5,2,MELISANDRE,I've done my part.  I've brought ice and fire together.
8861,5,2,VARYS,Strange.  You spoke so highly of Jon Snow but when he arrives you hide on a cliff.  I didn't take you for a bashful girl.
8862,5,2,MELISANDRE,My time whispering in the ears of kings has come to an end.
8863,5,2,VARYS,"Oh, I doubt that.  Give us common folk one taste of power we're like the lion who tasted man.  Nothing is ever so sweet again."
8864,5,2,MELISANDRE,"Neither of us is common folk anymore.  I did not part on good terms with the King in the North, or his advisor."
8865,5,2,VARYS,Why?
8866,5,2,MELISANDRE,Because of mistakes I made.  Terrible mistakes.  I would only be a distraction if I stayed.
8867,5,2,VARYS,So where will you go?
8868,5,2,MELISANDRE,Volantis.
8869,5,2,VARYS,"Good.  If you don't mind my saying, I don't think you should return to Westeros.  I'm not sure you'd be safe here."
8870,5,2,MELISANDRE,"I will return, dear spider.  One last time. VARYS begins shaking his head."
8871,5,2,VARYS,My Lady --
8872,5,2,MELISANDRE,"I have to die in this strange country, just like you. MELISANDRE turns and walks away leaving VARYS alone on the cliff."
8873,5,2,TO,"DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM JON approaches the throne room.  Dothraki guards open the doors and allow him in.  He is walking with TYRION, MISSANDEI, DAVOS and other Dothraki guards.  DAENERYS is sitting on the throne.  MISSANDEI begins addressing JON and DAVOS."
8874,5,2,MISSANDEI,"You stand in the presence of Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen, rightful heir to the Iron Throne, rightful Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms, the Mother of Dragons, the Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, The Unburnt, The Breaker of Chains. JON turns and looks at DAVOS."
8875,5,2,DAVOS,This is Jon Snow. DAVOS nods and pauses.
8876,5,2,DAVOS,He's King in the North. TYRION smirks to himself.
8877,5,2,DAENERYS,"Thank you for traveling so far, My Lords.  I hope the seas weren't too rough."
8878,5,2,JON,"The winds were kind, Your Grace."
8879,5,2,DAVOS,"Apologies.  I have a Flea Bottom accent, I know.  But Jon Snow is King in the North, Your Grace.  He's not a lord."
8880,5,2,DAENERYS,Forgive me --
8881,5,2,TYRION,"Your Grace, this is Ser Davos Seaworth."
8882,5,2,DAERNEYS,"Forgive me, Ser Davos.  I never did receive a formal education, but I could have sworn the last King in the North was Torren Stark who bent the knee to my ancestor Aegon Targaryen in exchange for his life and the lives of the northmen.  Torren Stark swore fealty to House Targaryen in perpetuity.  But do I have my facts wrong?"
8883,5,2,DAVOS,"I wasn't there, My Grace."
8884,5,2,DAENERYS,"No.  Of course not.  But still, an oath is an oath.  In perpetuity means -- what does perpetuity mean, Lord Tyrion?"
8885,5,2,TYRION,Forever.
8886,5,2,DAENERYS,"Forever.  So I assume, My Lord, that you're here to bend the knee."
8887,5,2,JON,I am not.
8888,5,2,DAENERYS,"Oh.  Well, that is unfortunate.  You've travelled all this way to break faith with House Targaryen?"
8889,5,2,JON,Break faith?  Your father burned my grandfather alive.  He burned my uncle alive.  He would have burned the Seven Kingdoms.
8890,5,2,DAENERYS,"My father was an evil man.  On behalf of House Targaryen I ask your forgiveness for the crimes he committed against your family.  And I ask you not to judge a daughter by the sins of her father.  Our two houses were allies for centuries.  Those were the best centuries the kingdom's ever known.  Centuries of peace and prosperity with the Targaryens sitting on the Iron Throne and a Stark serving as Warden of the North.  I am the last Targaryen, Jon Snow.  Honor the pledge your ancestor made to mine.  Bend the knee and I will name you Warden of the North.  Together we will save this country from those who would destroy it."
8891,5,2,JON,You're right.  You're not guilty of your father's crime.  And I'm not beholden to my ancestor's vows.
8892,5,2,DAENERYS,Then why are you here?
8893,5,2,JON,Because I need your help and you need mine. DAENERYS smirks and looks over at TYRION.  She starts speaking to JON again.
8894,5,2,DAENERYS,Did you see three dragons flying overhead when you arrived?
8895,5,2,JON,I did.
8896,5,2,DAENERYS,"And did you see the Dothraki, all of whom have sworn to kill for me?"
8897,5,2,JON,They're hard to miss.
8898,5,2,DAENERYS,"But still, I need your help?"
8899,5,2,DAVOS,"Not to defeat Cersei.  You could storm King's Landing tomorrow and the city would fall.  Hell, we almost took it and we didn't even have dragons."
8900,5,2,TYRION,Almost.
8901,5,2,JON,But you haven't stormed King's Landing.  Why not?  The only reason I can see is you don't want to kill thousands of innocent people.  It's the fastest way to win the war but you won't do it.  Which means at the very least you're better than Cersei.
8902,5,2,DAENERYS,"Still, that doesn't explain why I need your help."
8903,5,2,JON,"Because right now you and I and Cersei and everyone else, we're children playing at a game screaming that the rules aren't fair. DAENERYS turns to TYRION."
8904,5,2,DAENERYS,You told me you liked this man.
8905,5,2,TYRION,I do.
8906,5,2,DAENERYS,"In the time since he's met me he's refused to call me queen, he's refused to bow and now he's calling me a child."
8907,5,2,TYRION,I believe he's calling all of us children.  Figure of speech.
8908,5,2,JON,"Your Grace, everone you know will die before winter is over if we don't defeat the enemy to the north."
8909,5,2,DAENERYS,"As far as I can see, you are the enemy to the north."
8910,5,2,JON,I am not your enemy.  The dead are the enemy. DAENERYS pauses and is incredulous.
8911,5,2,DAENERYS,The dead? DAENERYS addresses TYRION.
8912,5,2,DAENERYS,Is that another figure of speech? JON answers her before Tyrion.
8913,5,2,JON,The Army of the Dead is on the march.
8914,5,2,TYRION,The Army of the Dead?
8915,5,2,JON,"You don't know me well, My Lord, but do you think I am a liar or a madman?"
8916,5,2,TYRION,"No, I don't think you're either of those things."
8917,5,2,JON,The Army of the Dead is real.  The White Walkers are real.  The Knight King is real.  I've seen them.  If they get past the wall and we're squabbling amongst ourselves -- JON begins walking closer to the throne.  The Dothraki guards step towards him to halt him.
8918,5,2,JON,-- we're finished. DAENERYS pauses a moment.
8919,5,2,DAENERYS,I was born at Dragonstone.  Not that I can remember it. DAENERYS stands from the throne and begins walking down the stairs towards JON.
8920,5,2,DAENERYS,"We fled before Robert's assassins could find us.  Robert was your father's best friend, no?  I wonder if your father knew his best friend sent assassins to murder a baby girl in her crib.  Not that it matters now of course.  I spent my life in foreign lands.  So many men have tried to kill me.  I don't remember all of their names.  I have been sold like a brood mare.  I have been chained and betrayed, raped and defiled.  Do you know what kept me standing through all those years in exile?  Faith.  Not in any gods.  Not in myths and legends.  In myself.  In Daenerys Targaryen.  The world hadn't seen a dragon in centuries until my children were born.  The Dothraki hadn't crossed the sea.  Any sea. DAENERYS stops walking and is face to face with JON."
8921,5,2,DAENERYS,They did for me.  I was born to rule the Seven Kingdoms.  And I will.
8922,5,2,JON,You'll be ruling over a graveyard if we don't defeat the Night King. Tyrion steps up to stand next to DAENERYS and speaks to JON.
8923,5,2,TYRION,The war against my sister has already begun.  You can't expect us to halt hostilities and join you in fighting -- TYRION pauses a moment.
8924,5,2,TYRION,-- whatever you saw beyond the wall.
8925,5,2,DAVOS,You don't believe him.  I understand that.  It sounds like nonsense. JON nods in agreement.
8926,5,2,DAVOS,"But if destiny has brough Daenerys Targaryen back to our shores, it has also made Jon Snow King in the North.  You were the first to bring Dothraki to Westeros.  He was the first to make allies with Wildlings and northmen.  He was named Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.  He was named King in the North.  Not because of his birthright.  He has no birthright.  He's a damn bastard.  All those hard son's of bitches chose him as their leader because they believe in him. DAENERYS stops looking at DAVOS and begins looking at JON."
8927,5,2,DAVOS,"All those things you don't believe in, he faced those things.  He fought those things for the good of his people.  He risked his life for his people.  He took a knife in the heart for his people.  He gave his own -- JON looks at DAVOS to cut him off.  DAVOS stops talking.  DAENERYS and TYRION exchange glances."
8928,5,2,DAVOS,If we don't put asside our enmities and band together we will die.  And then it doesn't matter whose skeleton sits on the Iron Throne.
8929,5,2,TYRION,If it doesn't matter you might as well kneel. JON shakes his head and looks at the floor.
8930,5,2,TYRION,Swear your allegiance to Queen Daenerys.  Help her to defeat my sister and together our armies will protect the north.
8931,5,2,JON,There's no time for that.  There's no time for any of this.  While we stand here debating --
8932,5,2,TYRION,It takes no time to bend the knee.  Pledge your sword to her cause.
8933,5,2,JON,And why would I do that? JON turns to speak to DAENERYS.
8934,5,2,JON,"I mean no offense, Your Grace, but I don't know you.  As far as I can tell your claim to the throne rests entirely on your father's name.  And my own father fought to overthrow the Mad King.  The lords of the north placed their trust in me to lead them.  And I will continue to do so as well as I can."
8935,5,2,DAENERYS,"That's fair.  It's also fair to point out that I'm the rightful queen of the Seven Kingdoms.  By declaring yourself king of the northern most kingdom, you are in open rebellion. VARYS walks quickly into the throne room and approaches DAENERYS.  He begins whispering in her ear."
8936,5,2,DAENERYS,You must forgive my manners.  You will both be tired after your long journey.  We'll have baths drawn for you and supper sent to your rooms. DAENERYS begins speaking Valyrian to her Queensguard.  Her guard steps forward to escort JON and DAVOS.  JON speaks to DAENERYS.
8937,5,2,JON,Am I your prisoner?
8938,5,2,DAENERYS,Not yet. DAENERYS begins walking back to the throne.  JON and DAVOS exit the throne room with a member of the Queensguard.  The Dothraki close the door to the throne room after JON and DAVOS exit.  VARYS begins speaking to DAENERYS.
8939,5,2,VARYS,Our Iron Born and Dornish allies were attacked on route to Dorne.
8940,5,2,DAENERYS,And?
8941,5,2,VARYS,Two or three ships escaped.  The rest sunk our captured.  Ellaria and the sand snakes dead or captured.  The Greyjoys are dead or captured.
8942,5,2,DAENERYS,All of them?
8943,5,2,TO,SEA OF DORNE Theon is hanging on to flotsam on the ocean.  A friendly Greyjoy ship is pulling him out of the water with a rope.  They haul him onto the ship and drop him on deck.  He is shivering and dishelveled.  The captain of the boat approaches THEON and speaks to him while THEON is laying on the deck.
8944,5,2,CAPTAIN,Your sister's dead?
8945,5,2,THEON,Euron has her.
8946,5,2,CAPTAIN,You saw him take her?  And you got away?
8947,5,2,THEON,I couldn't save her.  I tried.
8948,5,2,CAPTAIN,"You wouldn't be here if you tried. THEON turns his eyes away from the captain.  The captain turns and walks away.  The men go back to their duties, some stepping over THEON as he continues to lay on the deck."
8949,5,2,TO,"KING'S LANDING - STREETS EURON is escorting prisoners YARA GREYJOY, ELLARIA and TYENE SAND.  The prisoners are chained.  EURON is riding a horse.  He has a rope tied to YARA's neck and is leading her towards the Red Keep.  There is a large crowd shouting and cheering as they bring the prisoners through the streets.  EURON is smiling and showing off for the crowd.  The crowd shouts obscenities and curses at the prisoners. EURON(to YARA):  This is the life.  Look at them.  Cheering for a Greyjoy. EURON pulls on the rope around YARA's neck forcing her to run forward to stand next to EURON's horse."
8950,5,2,EURON,"I have to be honest, it's making me hard.  Did you see little Theon's face right before he jumped overboard? EURON begins mocking Theon in a high pitched voice."
8951,5,2,EURON,Oh no! EURON laughs.
8952,5,2,EURON,What a twat.
8953,5,2,TO,"RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM CERSEI is sitting on the throne surrounded by QYBURN, JAIME, and THE MOUNTAIN.  There is a crowd gathered and they're clapping as EURON brings the prisoners down the aisle towards the throne.  EURON climbs down from his horse and grabs the chains that bind ELLARIA and TYENE and starts walking them to the throne."
8954,5,2,EURON,My queen.  Please accept this gift on behalf of all of your loyal subjects in the Iron Islands. EURON throws the chains at the feet of CERSEI.
8955,5,2,EURON,I give you -- EURON looks over to JAIME.
8956,5,2,EURON,-- what no other man could give.  Justice.  Justice for your murdered daughter. ELLARIA spits onto the floor near the throne and CERSEI smiles.  CERSEI begins speaking to EURON.
8957,5,2,CERSEI,You've proven yourself the greatest captain on the 14 seas and a true friend to the crown. EURON leans in and speaks to CERSEI so the crowd can't hear.
8958,5,2,EURON,A bit more than a true friend.
8959,5,2,CERSEI,And you deserve a proper reward for your heroism.
8960,5,2,EURON,There's only one reward I want.
8961,5,2,CERSEI,You shall have what your heart desires -- JAIME looks over at CERSEI.
8962,5,2,CERSEI,-- when the war is won. CERSEI stands and addresses the people gathered in the throne room.
8963,5,2,CERSEI,"With Euron Greyjoy commanding our naval forces and Jaime Lannister leading our armies, the sons and daugters of Westeros shall defend our country. The crowd starts cheering and clapping.  CERSEI turns and walks back to the throne and sits.  EURON is waving to the crowd and begins speaking to JAIME."
8964,5,2,EURON,"There's nothing quite like it, is there?  The love of the people.  I suppose you wouldn't know."
8965,5,2,JAIME,"This same mob spat at my sister not long ago, and if you turn on us, they'll cheer to see your head mounted on a spike."
8966,5,2,EURON,"Or yours.  They just like severed heads really.  Listen, if you have any advice at all I'd love to hear it when we have an hour or two to speak as brothers."
8967,5,2,JAIME,Advice?
8968,5,2,EURON,Does she like it gentle or rough?  A finger in the bum? JAIME turns to EURON angrily.
8969,5,2,EURON,"Shhh, shhh, shhh, not now.  We'll talk later. EURON bows to the queen.  He walks down and collects YARA and walks out with her and his guards."
8970,5,2,TO,"RED KEEP - DUNGEONS THE MOUNTAIN, CERSEI and QYBURN are standing in a torch lit dungeon beneath the Red Keep.  ELLARIA and TYENE are chained to walls opposite of each other.  They are both gagged.  CERSEI speaks to ELLARIA."
8971,5,2,CERSEI,"I want you to know I understand.  Even though we're enemies, you and I, I understand the fear that drives you.  I was there that day when Ser Gregor crushed your lover's head.  I close my eyes I can hear the sound of Oberyn's skull breaking. ELLARIA struggles against her restraints"
8972,5,2,CERSEI,"The sound of your scream.  I never heard a sound like that.  I thought, that's true love.  Oberyn looked beautiful that day.  He really did.  No one moved like him.  No one had such skill with a spear.  Even Ser Gregor couldn't stop him.  If only he hadn't taunted him.  He could have walked away and left poor Ser Gregor to die.  But that wasn't your lover's way, was it?  Now he's burried somewhere.  And here Ser Gregor is stronger than ever.  That must be difficult for you.  When my daughter was taken from me, my only daughter, well, you can't imagine how that feels unless you've lost a child.  I fed her at my own breast even though they told me to give her to the wet nurse.  I couldn't bear to see her in another woman's arms.  I never got to have a mother.  But Myrcella did.  She was mine and you took her from me.  Why did you do that? CERSEI pauses and looks at ELLARIA."
8973,5,2,CERSEI,It doesn't matter now. CERSEI walks across the room and stands next to TYENE looking at her but continues speaking to ELLARIA.
8974,5,2,CERSEI,"Your daughter is a beauty too.  Brown eyes, those lips.  A perfect Dornish beauty. TYENE is looking from CERSEI to her mother, ELLARIA.  CERSAI stops looking at TYENE and turns back to ELLARIA."
8975,5,2,CERSEI,I imagine she is your favorite. ELLARIA pulls on her restraints.
8976,5,2,CERSEI,"I know, I know, we're not supposed to have favorites.  But still, we're only human.  We love who we love. ELLARIA begins gasping and trying to speak through her gag."
8977,5,2,CERSEI,I'm sorry.  I can't understand you.  The gag makes it difficult to understand what you're saying.  It must be frustrating. ELLARIA whimpers.
8978,5,2,CERSEI,We all make our choices.  You chose to murder my daughter.  You must have felt powerful after you made that choice. ELLARIA screams and pulls against her restraints.  She takes the slack out of the chain but is held in place inches from CERSEI.
8979,5,2,CERSEI,"Do you feel powerful now?  I don't sleep very well, not at all really.  I lie in bed and I stare at the canopy and imagine ways of killing my enemies.  How to destroy Ellaria Sand, the woman who murdered my only daughter.  I thought about having Ser Gregor crush your skull the way he did Oberyn's.  It would be poetic I suppose but fast.  Too fast. CERSEI turns away from ELLARIA and walks back to TYENE and takes TYENE's face in her hands.  She continues talking to ELLARIA."
8980,5,2,CERSEI,I thought about having him crush your daughter's skull. CERSEI removes the gag from TYENE's mouth.
8981,5,2,CERSEI,"She's so beautiful.  The thought of this lovely face cracking open like a duck egg, no, it's just not right. CERSEI is caressing TYENE's face.  CERSEI looks at ELLARIA, then turns back and kisses TYENE.  TYENE is whimpering.  CERSEI stops kissing TYENE and looks back at ELLARIA."
8982,5,2,TYENE,Momma! ELLARIA screams and looks at CERSEI.  QYBURN steps to TYENE and puts the gag back on her mouth.  TYENE is crying.  QYBURN walks over to CERSEI and hands her a cloth.  ELLARIA falls down to her knees and is watching her daughter.  CERSEI starts wiping off the red lipstick she was wearing.  CERSEI speaks to ELLARIA.
8983,5,2,CERSEI,"Qyburn, he's the cleverest man I know.  Clever enough to learn what poison you used to murder Myrcella.  The long goodbye, was that it?"
8984,5,2,QYBURN,The Long Farewell. QYBURN hands CERSEI a vile containing the posion antidote.
8985,5,2,CERSEI,That's the one. CERSEI drinks the antidote.
8986,5,2,CERSEI,How long does the poison take?
8987,5,2,QYBURN,"Difficult to say.  Hours, days, it depends on the subject's constitution."
8988,5,2,CERSEI,But death is certain?
8989,5,2,QYBURN,"Oh yes, Your Grace, quite certain. ELLARIA is still on her knees crying.  CERSEI squats down to talk to her."
8990,5,2,CERSEI,"Your daughter will die here in this cell.  You will be here watching when she does.  You will be here the rest of your days.  If you refuse to eat we will force food down your throat.  You will live to watch your daughter rot, to watch that beautiful face collapse to bone and dust all the while contemplating the choices you've made. CERSEI continues looking at ELLARIA but speaks to QYBURN."
8991,5,2,CERSEI,Make sure the guards change the torches every few hours.  I don't want her to miss a thing. CERSEI stands and walks out of the chamber with her entourage.  TYENE and ELLARIA both strain against their chains but can't reach each other.
8992,5,2,TO,RED KEEP - JAIME'S QUARTERS JAIME sets his gold hand down on the table and pours himself a glass of wine.  CERSEI barges in and approaches him.  CERSEI starts kissing JAIME.
8993,5,2,JAIME,No. CERSEI kisses JAIME.  JAIME stands.  CERSEI unties his pants and gets on her knees.  Sex scene ensues.  Some time has passed.  CERSEI is asleep and JAIME is watching her in bed.  There's a knock at the door.
8994,5,2,JAIME,"Don't. CERSEI kisses JAIME, gets out of bed and covers herself with a robe.  JAIME sits up concerned."
8995,5,2,JAIME,What are you doing?  No one can see us like this ?
8996,5,2,CERSEI,I am queen of the Seven Kingdoms.  I'll do as I please. CERSEI walks over and opens the door.  A messenger looks in and sees JAIME in the bed.
8997,5,2,MESSENGER,"Forgive me, Your Grace.  The visitor from Braavos has arrived."
8998,5,2,CERSEI,Good.  And we'll need fresh sheets for the bed.
8999,5,2,MESSENGER,"At once, Your Grace. CERSEI closes the door.  JAIME lays his head against his pillows and laughs nervously."
9000,5,2,TO,RED KEEP - COUNCIL ROOM CERSEI is pouring two glasses of wine.  She carries them over and offers one to TYCHO NESTORIS of the Iron Bank.
9001,5,2,TYCHO,"No, thank you. CERSEI carries both glasses to her desk and sits down."
9002,5,2,TYCHO,"My condolences, Your Grace, on the death of your son.  From all reports he was a fine young man."
9003,5,2,CERSEI,The Iron Bank didn't send you hear to offer condolences.
9004,5,2,TYCHO,Condolences and congratulations.  You've become the first ruling queen in the Seven Kingdoms.  That's quite an accomplishment.  The Iron Bank appreciates how you cast off the yoke of superstition freeing the crown from elements that sought to subvert the rule of law.
9005,5,2,CERSEI,The destruction of the Sept of Baelor was a tragic accident.
9006,5,2,TYCHO,Indeed.  But sometimes tragedies are necessary to restore order and rational leadership.
9007,5,2,CERSEI,The Iron Bank wants its gold back.
9008,5,2,TYCHO,"Your father never minced words either.  But, yes, your debts are considerable.  And you are now engaged in a conflict on several fronts.  We both know how expensive war can be."
9009,5,2,CERSEI,And we both know gold wins wars.  Your vaults are empty.  Your late husband's profligacy saw to that.
9010,5,2,TYCHO,Your wealthiest ally is the Tyrells who are now your enemies.  You're surrounded on all sides by rivals for the throne.
9011,5,2,CERSEI,And the Iron Bank wants to bet on a winner.
9012,5,2,TYCHO,We don't make bets.  We invest in endeavors we deem likely to be successful.
9013,5,2,CERSEI,That's a fancy way of saying bet.  The war has already begun.  I've drawn first blood.  I decapitated the Dornish snake.  My armada owns the Narrow Sea.
9014,5,2,TYCHO,Euron Greyjoy's armada owns the Narrow Sea.
9015,5,2,CERSEI,Euron Greyjoy is loyal to me.
9016,5,2,TYCHO,For now.  Daenerys Targaryen has three full grown dragons.  How well do wooden ships fare against fire breathing dragons?
9017,5,2,CERSEI,"Her dragons might not be as invulnerable as some think.  Now, let's talk about the Targaryen girl.  You want to invest in her?  I'm guessing the Iron Bank invested considerable gold in the slave trade.  How are you profits now that Daenerys has freed all the slaves?"
9018,5,2,TYCHO,"The slave trade has entered a down turn, it's true."
9019,5,2,CERSEI,From what I gather she considers herself more of a revolutionary that a monarch.  In your experience how do bankers usually fare with revoltionaries? TYCHO begins to speak but CERSEI cuts him off.
9020,5,2,CERSEI,The Lannisters owe the Iron Bank quite a lot of money but Lannisters always pay their debts.  Do former slaves or Dothraki or dragons?
9021,5,2,TYCHO,Your father's daughter indeed.
9022,5,2,CERSEI,Give me a fortnight.  Stay in King's Landing as my honored guest and when you return to Braavos I swear to you my debt will be paid in full.
9023,5,2,TO,DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS TYRION is walking along the cliffs and sees JON standing alone looking out into the ocean.  TYRION approaches JON and speaks to him.
9024,5,2,TYRION,I came out here to brood over my failure to predict the Greyjoy attack.  You're making it difficult.  You look a lot better brooding than I do.  You make me feel like I'm failing at brooding over failing.
9025,5,2,JON,I'm a prisoner on this island.
9026,5,2,TYRION,"I wouldn't say you're a prisoner on this island.  You're free to walk the castle, the beaches, to go wherever you want."
9027,5,2,JON,Except to my ship.  They took my ship.
9028,5,2,TYRION,I wouldn't say we took your ship.
9029,5,2,JON,I'm not playing word games with you.  The dead are coming for us all.
9030,5,2,TYRION,"Why don't you figure out what to do about my missing fleet and murdered allies, and I'll figure out what to do about your walking dead men."
9031,5,2,JON,It's hard for me to fathom.  It really is.  If someone told me about the White Walkers and the Night King -- JON pauses and hangs his head.
9032,5,2,JON,You probably don't believe me.
9033,5,2,TYRION,I do actually.
9034,5,2,JON,You didn't before. Grumpkins and snarks you called them. Do you remember?  You said it was all nonsense.
9035,5,2,TYRION,"It was all nonsense.  Everybody knew it.  But then Mormont saw them and you saw them, and I trust the eyes of an honest man more than I trust what everybody knows."
9036,5,2,JON,How do I convince people who don't know me that an enemey they don't believe in is coming to kill them all?
9037,5,2,TYRION,Good question.
9038,5,2,JON,I know it's a good question.  I'm looking for an answer.
9039,5,2,TYRION,"People's minds aren't made for problems that large.  White Walkers, the Night King, Army of the Dead, it's almost a relief to confront a familiar monster like my sister."
9040,5,2,JON,I need to help prepare my people for what's coming.  I can't help them from here.  I'd like to leave.
9041,5,2,TYRION,It seems unlikely that you became King in the North by giving up that easily.
9042,5,2,JON,"Everyone told me to learn from my father's mistakes.  Don't go south.  Don't answer a summons from the Mad King's daughter, a foreign invader.  And here I am.  A northern fool."
9043,5,2,TYRION,"Children are not their fathers, luckily for all of us.  And sometimes there's more to foreign invaders than northern fools that meets the eye.  Daenerys could have sailed for Westeros long ago but she didn't.  Instead she stayed where she was and saved many people from horrible fates some of whom are on this island with us right now.  While you're our guest here you might consider asking them what they think of the Mad King's daughter.  She protects people from monsters, just as you do.  That's why she came here.  And she's not about to head north to fight an enemy she's never seen on a word of a man she doesn't know after a single meeting.  That's not a reasonable thing to ask. JON turns from TYRION and begins to walk away."
9044,5,2,TYRION,So do you have anything reasonable to ask? JON stops and turns back around.
9045,5,2,JON,What do you mean?
9046,5,2,TYRION,Maybe you are a northern fool.  I'm asking if there's something I can do to help you.
9047,5,2,TO,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE DAENERYS and TYRION are having a discussion.
9048,5,2,DAENERYS,Dragonglass?
9049,5,2,TYRION,"Yes.  Volcanic glass, obsidian.  He says you have a tremendous amount of it here."
9050,5,2,DAENERYS,Why are we talking about glass?  We just lost two of our allies.
9051,5,2,TYRION,"Which is why I was speaking to Jon Snow, a potential ally."
9052,5,2,DAENERYS,And what does the King in the North want with Dragonglass?
9053,5,2,TYRION,"Apparently it can be turned into weapons that kill White Walkers and their foot soldiers, or stop them, destroy them.  I'm unsure of the nomenclature."
9054,5,2,DAENERYS,And what do you think of this Army of the Dead and White Walkers and Night Kings?
9055,5,2,TYRION,"I'd very much like to believe that Jon Snow is wrong, but a wise man once said that you should never believe a thing simply because you want to believe it."
9056,5,2,DAENERYS,Which wise man said this?
9057,5,2,TYRION,I don't remember.
9058,5,2,DAENERYS,Are you trying to present your own statements as ancient wisdom?
9059,5,2,TYRION,"I would never do that...to you.  The reason I believe Jon Snow is because he's here.  All of his advisors would have told him not to come.  I would have told him not to come, yet he's here anyway.  You don't have to believe him.  Let him mine the Dragonglass.  If he's wrong it's worthless.  You didn't even know it was here.  It's nothing to you.  Give him something by giving him nothing.  Take a step toward a more productive relationship with a possible ally.  Keep him occupied while we focus on the task at hand.  Casterly Rock."
9060,5,2,DAENERYS,What was that Ser Davos said about taking a knife in the heart for his people?  Did you notice that?
9061,5,2,TYRION,You must allow them their flights of fancy.  It's dreary in the north.
9062,5,2,TO,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAYS DAENERYS is at the bottom of the path looking out into the ocean.  Dragons are flying over the ocean and over the mountains in the distance.  JON approaches DAENERYS from the top of the stairs.
9063,5,2,JON,Amazing thing to see.
9064,5,2,DAENERYS,I named them for my brothers Vicerys and Rhaegon.  They're both gone now. DAENERYS turns to look at JON.
9065,5,2,DAENERYS,You lost two brothers as well? JON shakes his head.
9066,5,2,DAENERYS,People thought dragons were gone forever but here they are.  Perhaps we should all be examining what we think we know.
9067,5,2,JON,You've been talking to Tyrion?
9068,5,2,DAENERYS,He is my Hand.
9069,5,2,JON,He enjoys talking.
9070,5,2,DAENERYS,We all enjoy what we're good at.
9071,5,2,JON,I don't. DAENERYS pauses and looks at JON.
9072,5,2,DAENERYS,You know I'm not going to let Cersei stay on the Iron Throne.
9073,5,2,JON,I never expected that you would.
9074,5,2,DAENERYS,And I haven't changed my mind about which kingdoms belong to the throne.
9075,5,2,JON,I haven't either.
9076,5,2,DAENERYS,I will allow you to mine the Dragonglass and forge weapons from it.  Any resources or men you need I will provide for you.
9077,5,2,JON,Thank you. DAENERYS turns back to the ocean.
9078,5,2,JON,So you believe me then about the Night King and the Army of the Dead?
9079,5,2,DAENERYS,"You better get to work, Jon Snow. JON turns and quickly walks up the stairs towards the castly."
9080,5,2,TO,"WINTERFELL - COURTYARD Men are working in the courtyard rolling carts of hey and carrying water.  A blacksmith is working the forge.  SANSA, PETER BAELISH, YOHN ROYCE and MAESTER WOLKAN are standing on the upper level of the courtyard having a discussion."
9081,5,2,SANSA,How much do we have?
9082,5,2,WOLKAN,"4,000 bushels, My Lady."
9083,5,2,SANSA,What does that mean?
9084,5,2,YOHN,"For the current occupants of the castle it's enough food for a year, perhaps more. SANSA begins walking and everyone follows."
9085,5,2,SANSA,What's the longest winter in the past 100 years?
9086,5,2,WOLKAN,I'm not entirely certain.  I'll check Maester Llewyn's records.  He kept a copy of every raven scroll. SANSA and the men walk from the upper level down into the courtyard.
9087,5,2,SANSA,"You're telling me we don't have enough food, especially not if the armies of the north come back to defend Winterfell."
9088,5,2,WOLKAN,"No, My Lady, most likely not."
9089,5,2,SANSA,"We must prepare for that eventuality.  Every direction the threat comes from, this is the best place to be.  We need to start building up our grain stores with regular shipments from every keep in the north.  If we don't use it by winter's end we'll give it back to them, but if the entire north has to flee to Winterfell there won't be enough time to bring wagonloads of grain with them."
9090,5,2,YOHN,"Very wise, My Lady."
9091,5,2,SANSA,"Maester Wolkan, you'll see to it? WOLKAN bows and leaves.  SANSA and the others keep walking through the courtyard.  SANSA sees smiths hammering breastplate."
9092,5,2,SANSA,Are they covering those breastplates in leather?
9093,5,2,YOHN,"No, My Lady."
9094,5,2,SANSA,"Well, shouldn't they be once the real cold comes?"
9095,5,2,YOHN,"They should indeed.  Pardon me, My Lady. YOHN steps over to the blacksmith."
9096,5,2,YOHN,"You there, why isn't there leather on these? SANSA and BAELISH continue walking."
9097,5,2,BAELISH,Command suits you.  The northerns are all facing north worried about the threat beyond the wall.
9098,5,2,SANSA,So they should be.
9099,5,2,BAELISH,I know Cersei better than anyone here.  If you turn your back on her --
9100,5,2,SANSA,You don't know Cersei better than anyone here.
9101,5,2,BAELISH,I only meant to say --
9102,5,2,SANSA,"That the woman who murdered my mother, father and brother is dangerous?  Thank you for your wise council."
9103,5,2,BAELISH,"One of two things will happen.  Either the dead will defeat the living, in which case all our troubles come to an end.  Or life will win out.  And what then? BAELISH walks in front of SANSA and stops her."
9104,5,2,BAELISH,"Don't fight in the north or the south.  Fight every battle everywhere always in your mind.  Everyone is your enemy, everyone is your friend, every possible series of events is happening all at once.  Live that way and nothing will surprise you.  Everything that happens will be something that you've seen before. A Winterfell guard approaches SANSA and BAELISH."
9105,5,2,GUARD,"Lady Sansa, at the gate. SANSA turns and walks away from BAELISH.  There is a commotion at the gate.  People are gathered around.  SANSA rushes over to see what's going on.  Bran is in a cart in the Winterfell courtyard.  Bran looks at SANSA for a few moments without saying anything."
9106,5,2,BRAN,"Hello, Sansa. SANSA begins to cry and hugs BRAN."
9107,5,2,TO,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE SANSA and BRAN are sitting next to the Weirwood Tree having a discussion.
9108,5,2,SANSA,I wish Jon was here.
9109,5,2,BRAN,Yes.  I need to speak to him.
9110,5,2,SANSA,Your father's last living true born son.  You're Lord of Winterfell.
9111,5,2,BRAN,I can never be the Lord of Winterfell.  I can never be lord of anything.  I'm the three-eyed raven.
9112,5,2,SANSA,I don't know what that means.
9113,5,2,BRAN,It's difficult to explain.
9114,5,2,SANSA,"Try, please, for me."
9115,5,2,BRAN,"It means I can see everything.  Everything that's ever happened to everyone.  Everything that's happening right now.  It's all pieces, fragments.  I need to learn to see better.  When the long night comes again I need to be ready."
9116,5,2,SANSA,How do you know all of this?
9117,5,2,BRAN,The three-eyed raven taught me.
9118,5,2,SANSA,I thought you were the three-eyed raven.
9119,5,2,BRAN,I told you it's difficult to explain.
9120,5,2,SANSA,Bran --
9121,5,2,BRAN,I'm sorry for all that's happened to you.  I'm sorry it had to happen here at our home.  It was so beautiful that night.  Snow falling just like now.  And you were so beautiful in your white wedding dress. SANSA appears shaken.  She quickly stands up to leave.
9122,5,2,SANSA,"I have to go back inside, Bran."
9123,5,2,BRAN,I'll stay a bit longer.
9124,5,2,TO,"CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS ARCHMAESTER MARWYN, SAMWELL TARLEY and JORAH MORMONT are standing in JORAH's quarantine room.  JORAH's skin has scars over the surface and the Greyscale is completely gone.  MARWYN extends a medical tool and begins poking around to examine JORAH."
9125,5,2,MARWYN,Hmm. MARWYN walks around JORAH and continues to exam him.
9126,5,2,MARWYN,Hmm.  Does it hurt?
9127,5,2,JORAH,A bit.  Less than before.
9128,5,2,MARWYN,The infection no longer appears to be active. JORAH sighs with relief and looks at the floor.
9129,5,2,MARWYN,Unusual.  Unlikely.  One could almost be forgiven for thinking the entire upper layer of diseased skin was debrided and the underlying region treated with some sort of ointment.
9130,5,2,JORAH,I don't know anything about that.  I just started feeling better.  I assumed it was the rest that did it. SAMWELL begins nodding his head in agreement.
9131,5,2,JORAH,And the climate.
9132,5,2,MARWYN,"The climate?  You're free to go, Ser.  This chamber is needed for the infectious, which you are no longer. MARWYN begins walking out of the room."
9133,5,2,MARWYN,"Tarley, I'd like to speak with you in my study this evening. JORAH and SAMWELL stay in the room and have a discussion."
9134,5,2,JORAH,How bad is it?
9135,5,2,SAMWELL,I suppose I'll find out this evening. JORAH smiles and nods at SAMWELL.   He turns around and picks up his shirt.
9136,5,2,SAMWELL,Where will you go? JORAH puts on his shirt and begins tying it up.
9137,5,2,JORAH,I surrendered to this sickness the moment I first saw it.  I knew it would kill me or I'd kill myself before it could.  Daenerys Stormborn convinced me otherwise.  The only place for me is with her. JORAH turns to face SAMWELL.
9138,5,2,JORAH,I owe my life to her and you.
9139,5,2,SAMWELL,Your father saved me more than once.  It's the least I could do. JORAH nods his head.
9140,5,2,JORAH,Perhaps our paths will cross again?
9141,5,2,SAMWELL,"I hope they do. SAMWELL reaches out to shake JORAH's hand.  JORAH hesitates for a moment, then takes SAMWELL's hand.  JORAH places his second hand over SAMWELL's.  SAMWELL turns and walks out of the room leaving JORAH alone.  JORAH looks out the window and smiles."
9142,5,2,TO,ARCHMAESTER'S STUDY MARWYN AND SAMWELL are having a discussion.
9143,5,2,MARWYN,You treated him?
9144,5,2,SAMWELL,Yes.
9145,5,2,MARWYN,Who told you to treat him?
9146,5,2,SAMWELL,No one.
9147,5,2,MARWYN,Who forbade you or anyone to attempt to treat him?
9148,5,2,SAMWELL,I seem to remember you.
9149,5,2,MARWYN,But you treated him anyway?
9150,5,2,SAMWELL,I did.
9151,5,2,MARWYN,"I forbade it because it's dangerous and rarely successful.  Especially on someone of that age.  You could have infected yourself and others.  You could have devastated the entire Citadel.  But you didn't.  It's a meticulous, difficult procedure.  Many maesters whose chains are heavy with healing links have attempted it and failed.  But you succeeded.  How?"
9152,5,2,SAMWELL,I read the books and followed the instructions. MARWYN stands up and walks from behind his desk.
9153,5,2,MARWYN,That man is alive because of you.  You should be proud.
9154,5,2,SAMWELL,"Thank you, Archmaester."
9155,5,2,MARWYN,Come here. MARWYN and SAMWELL walk to a table in the study.  It's covered in moldy books and scrolls.
9156,5,2,MARWYN,All these manuscripts and scrolls and rotting away.  I need you to make copies of them. SAMWELL says nothing.
9157,5,2,MARWYN,You were expecting a reward?  Your reward is not being immediately expelled from the Citadel.  You'd better get started.  Be mindful of the paper mites.  They like flesh as well. MARWYN walks out of the room to leave SAMWELL to his work.
9158,5,2,TO,"DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE DAENERYS, VARYS, MISSANDEI and TYRION are standing around the painted table having a discussion.  TYRION knocks over one of the figurines as DAENERYS and VARYS speak."
9159,5,2,DAENERYS,We need to find Euron Greyjoy's fleet and sink it.
9160,5,2,VARYS,"Your Grace, he's already destroyed a good portion of our fleet.  To send our remaining ships after him --"
9161,5,2,DAENERYS,I'm not talking about sending our ships after him. DAENERYS pauses and looks at VARYS.  VARYS looks at TYRION.
9162,5,2,TYRION,But you'll have to go yourself.  Euron's ships could be anywhere or in more than one place.  You'd be flying around the open seas alone for who knows how long.
9163,5,2,DAENERYS,"I wouldn't be alone.  I'd have Drogon, Vicerion and Rhaegal.  What can anyone do to them?"
9164,5,2,MISSANDEI,They can still do something to you.  It only takes one arrow.
9165,5,2,TYRION,It's too great a risk.  You're too important. DAENERYS looks down at the painted table.
9166,5,2,DAENERYS,What about Casterly Rock?
9167,5,2,VARYS,The Unsullied will be there soon.
9168,5,2,MISSANDEI,And what will they face?
9169,5,2,VARYS,A difficult situation.  They know we're coming.
9170,5,2,TYRION,Yes.  Cersei believes my sole purpose in life is to destroy House Lannister.  She will be ready.
9171,5,2,TO,CASTERLY ROCK TYRION continues narrating as the castle is seen in the distance on top of some cliffs.
9172,5,2,TYRION,No one has ever taken the rock. Lannister archers are shown on top of the battlements.  There are hundreds of ships sailing in the ocean heading to Casterly Rock.
9173,5,2,TYRION,"The Lannister army is still the army my father built.  Well trained and well provisioned.  10,000 men at least.  They will see us coming. GREY WORM is standing in a landing boat with other Unsullied on their way to the beach.  He puts on his helmet and readies himself for battle."
9174,5,2,TYRION,They will be ready. A man is running across the battlements stocking arrows for the archers.  Men are stacking rocks along the wall to throw down at the invaders.
9175,5,2,MAN,Draw!  Loose! Archers loose a set of arrows down onto rows of Unsullied marching on the walls of the castle.
9176,5,2,TYRION,The gates of Casterly Rock are impregnable. Unsullied are being killed by incoming arrows.  Unsullied soldiers begin setting up ladders to scale the battlements.  The Lannister army throws rocks from the top of the wall.
9177,5,2,TYRION,The fight up the walls will be hard.  We'll be at a disadvantage.  Many men will die. The archers are easily defending the castle and killing Unsullied soldiers.
9178,5,2,TO,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE TYRION starts narrating a different battle plan.
9179,5,2,TYRION,"Interesting thing about my father.  He built our house up from near ruin.  He built our army.  He built Casterly Rock as we know it, but he didn't build the sewers.  That was beneath him.  So he gave the job to the lowest person he could find.  Me.  He was right.  I was low.  The company I kept low, women mostly.  They weren't welcome at the Rock.  Father disapproved of that sort of behavior.  I couldn't walk them through the front gates.  I couldn't have them in my chambers.  So in the process of building the sewers I threw in something for myself."
9180,5,2,TO,CASTERLY ROCK - CLIFFS TYRION continues to narrate.  GREY WORM is in a landing boat sailing for a small opening in the side of a cliff.
9181,5,2,TYRION,It was a passage that began by the sea and ended beneath one of the main guard towers. The Unsullied sail into the passage.  They jump out of the boat and rush into the sewers.  GREY WORM pushes up a manhole cover and emerges into the castle.  Guards are seen running by and don't notice GREY WORM and the other Unsullied soldiers sneaking in.
9182,5,2,TYRION,"No better place for low pursuits.  Casterly Rock, the impregnable fortress. The Unsullied are running through the courtyard cutting down Lannister men."
9183,5,2,TYRION,"As a good friend of mine once said, ""give me 10 good men and I'll impregnate the bitch."" The Unsullied fight their way to the main door in the courtyard.  GREY WORM lifts off the bar and opens the door.  Unsullied soldiers coming rushing through the gate by the hundreds.  They begin cutting down every Lannister in their way."
9184,5,2,TYRION,And so it begins.  They will face the bulk of the Lannister forces.  They will be outnumbered.  They will have less armor and fewer weapons. There is general mayhem as the battle rages on in the courtyard.  GREY WORM breaks from the main fight and starts climbing to the battlements.  He is disposing of men with his spear on the way.
9185,5,2,TYRION,"But as my sister's armies fights for her, the Unsullied will be fighting for something greater.  They will be fighting for freedom and the person who gave it to them.  They will be fighting for you.  And that is why they will triump. GREY WORM is fighting in a hallway killing men from both directions.  A Lannister charges towards GREY WORM.  GREY WORM throws his spear and impales the Lannister soldier to a door.  The battle is over.  GREY WORM and other Unsullied soldiers are stepping over dozens of dead Lannisters on the battlements.  GREY WORM removes his helmet and one of his men speak in Valyrian. UNSULLIED 1:  There are none left."
9186,5,2,WORM,There are supposed to be more than this.  Many more. GREY WORM turns to look out from the battlements towards the ocean.  The Unsullied fleet is under attack from the Iron Fleet and many boats are sunk or in flames.  GREY WORM's face twists in anger.  GREY WORM steps down from the battlement and grabs a bleeding Lannister soldier.  GREY WORM begins speaking English.
9187,5,2,WORM,Where are they?  Where are the rest of the Lannisters?
9188,5,2,TO,"HIGHGARDEN - FIELDS Thousands of fully armored Lannister soldiers are marching towards Highgarden.  JAIME is riding his horse inspecting the lines of soldiers.  He rides over and joins BRONN, RANDYLL TARLEY and DICKON TARLEY.  The camera shifts focus to Lady Olenna who is watching the advancing army from a balcony in Highgarden.  She turns and walks back into her castle."
9189,5,2,TO,HIGHGARDEN - COURTYARD Some time has passed.  The battle is already over.  JAIME is walking in the courtyard and there are dead Tyrell men scattered everywhere.  JAIME climbs to the top of the tower to meet OLENNA TYRELL.
9190,5,2,TO,OLENNA'S QUARTERS Olenna is sitting alone at a table wearing all black.  JAIME opens the door and enters the room.
9191,5,2,OLENNA,It's done?
9192,5,2,JAIME,It is.
9193,5,2,OLENNA,And now the rains weep for our whores.  Did we fight well?
9194,5,2,JAIME,I suppose as well as can be expected. JAIME walks to the wine and pours two glasses.
9195,5,2,OLENNA,It was never our forte.  Golden roses indeed.  Your brother and his new queen thought you would be defending Casterly Rock.
9196,5,2,JAIME,"The truth is Casterly Rock isn't worth much anymore.  Well, it is to me.  My fond childhood memories won't keep Cersei on the throne."
9197,5,2,OLENNA,So you'll just let them take it?
9198,5,2,JAIME,"For now.  They won't be able to hold it.  Euron Greyjoy's navy burned their ships, we emptied the larders before we left.  Eventually they'll be forced to abandon their position and march all the way across Westeros. JAIME walks to where OLENNA is sitting and places both wine glasses on the table and sits down."
9199,5,2,OLENNA,"And you took your army, your real army, and went where they weren't?"
9200,5,2,JAIME,As Robb Stark did to me at Whispering Wood.  There are always lessons in failures.
9201,5,2,OLENNA,Yes.  You must be very wise by now.
9202,5,2,JAIME,My father always said I was a slow learner.
9203,5,2,OLENNA,"If he was so clever why didn't he take Highgarden the moment your gold mines ran dry?  I suppose I'll be able to ask him myself soon enough.  No more learning from my mistakes, eh?  How will you do it?  With that sword? JAIME shakes his head no."
9204,5,2,OLENNA,"That was Joffrey's sword, wasn't it?  Not that he ever used it.  What did he call it?"
9205,5,2,JAIME,Widow's Wail.
9206,5,2,OLENNA,"He really was a cunt, wasn't he?  I did unspeakable things to protect my family, or watched them being done on my orders.  I never lost a night's sleep over them.  They were necessary.  And whatever I imagined necessary for the safety of House Tyrell I did.  But your sister has done things I wasn't capable of imagining.  That was my prize mistake, a failure of imagination.  She's a monster, you do know that?"
9207,5,2,JAIME,"To you, sure.  To others as well.  But after we've won and there's no one left to oppose us, the people living peaceful in the world she built, do you really think they'll wring their hands over the way she built it?"
9208,5,2,OLENNA,You love her.  You really do love her.  You poor fool.  She'll be the end of you.
9209,5,2,JAIME,"Possibly.  Not much to be gained from discussing it with you though, is there?"
9210,5,2,OLENNA,What better person to discuss it with?  What better guarantee could you have that the things you say will never leave this room?  But perhaps you're right.  If she's driven you this far it's gone beyond your control.
9211,5,2,JAIME,"Yes, it has."
9212,5,2,OLENNA,She's a disease.  I regret my role in spreading it.  You will too.
9213,5,2,JAIME,I think we're done here. JAIME stands up and moves closer to OLENNA.
9214,5,2,OLENNA,How will it happen?
9215,5,2,JAIME,Cersei had several ideas.  Whipping you through the streets and beheading you in front of the Red Keep.  Flaying you alive and hanging you from the walls of King's Landing.  I talked her out of those. OLENNA looks up at JAIME.  JAIME produces a small vial from a pouch on his belt and pops the cork off with his thumb.  He pours the contents of the vial into one of the glasses of wine and slides it in front of OLENNA.
9216,5,2,OLENNA,Will there be pain?
9217,5,2,JAIME,No.  I made sure of that.
9218,5,2,OLENNA,That's good. OLENNA reaches out and takes the wine.  She drinks the entire cup.  She looks back to JAIME.
9219,5,3,DEFAULT,The Spoils of War (Script) Lyrics EPISODE 4 - THE SPOILS OF WAR TITLE SEQUENCE EXT. HIGHGARDEN - THE KING'S ROAD The road leading from Highgarden is filled with men and carriages.  Lannister soldiers are marching back to King's Landing after sacking the castle.  JAIME yells out to a passing wagon.
9220,5,3,JAIME,Halt that wagon! JAIME opens the carriage.  It is filled with gold bars and coins.  He picks up a large sack and hands it to BRONN.
9221,5,3,BRONN,You just won the biggest prize in the world.  What could you possibly have to be upset about?  Come on.  You can tell me.  Queen of Thorns give you one last prick in the balls before saying goodbye?
9222,5,3,JAIME,I'll save my confessions for the High Septon.
9223,5,3,BRONN,There is no more High Septon.
9224,5,3,JAIME,"No, there isn't, is there?"
9225,5,3,BRONN,There is still the question of my prize. JAIME is putting a padlock on the wagon bearing the gold.  He stops and turns to BRONN.
9226,5,3,JAIME,That's a lot of money I just gave you.
9227,5,3,BRONN,It's not a castle. BRONN turns and points to Highgarden.
9228,5,3,BRONN,How about that one?  It's available.
9229,5,3,JAIME,You don't want Highgarden.
9230,5,3,BRONN,I beg to differ.
9231,5,3,JAIME,"We're at war.  Daenerys Targaryen could come take it back the day after you move in.  Besides, think of the upkeep.  The more you own, the more it weighs you down."
9232,5,3,BRONN,"Oh, is that why you're so fucking glum, eh?  All your new riches weighing you down? JAIME pounds on the back of the carriage and the horses start trotting."
9233,5,3,JAIME,They're not mine.  The gold belongs to the Iron Bank.  We pay our debts.
9234,5,3,BRONN,Right.  Just not to me.
9235,5,3,JAIME,"Bronn of the Blackwater, formerly of whatever nameless shit heap you're from with a saddlebag full of gold complaining about not getting paid.  When we win this war all the castles in the Seven Kingdoms will be yours to choose from with no one left to take them away from you."
9236,5,3,BRONN,"Yes, I'm sure Queen Cersei's reign will be quiet and peaceful."
9237,5,3,JAIME,Stranger things have happened.
9238,5,3,BRONN,Like what? RANDYLL TARLEY and his son DICKON come riding up on horseback.  RANDYLL addresses JAIME.
9239,5,3,RANDYLL,"The granaries are being emptied and loaded into wagons, My Lord."
9240,5,3,JAIME,The current harvest?
9241,5,3,DICKON,We have teams of men collecting it and more farmers in the Reach. JAIME looks over to BRONN.
9242,5,3,JAIME,"Ser Bronn, will you accompany the Tarleys and help them accelerate this process?"
9243,5,3,BRONN,I'm not much for shoveling weight.
9244,5,3,JAIME,"No, but motivating reluctant farmers to hand over their harvest, I've heard you guys have a real talent for that."
9245,5,3,RANDYLL,My Lord.
9246,5,3,DICKON,"My Lord. RANDYLL, DICKON and BRONN break away from the Lannister army and ride into the distance.  Horse drawn carts are carrying spoils from Highgarden and Lannister men are marching down the road."
9247,5,3,TO,REDKEEP - COUNCIL ROOM CERSEI and TYCHO NESTORIS from the Iron Bank of Braavos are sitting having a discussion.
9248,5,3,TYCHO,"I must say, I don't think the Iron Bank has ever had a debt of this magnitude repaid in a single installment.  I always considered your father a very effective and efficient man, but you appear to be redefining those terms entirely."
9249,5,3,CERSEI,"You're too kind, My Lord."
9250,5,3,TYCHO,"I am neither kind, nor a lord, Your Grace.  I am merely an instrument of the institution I represent, its wellbeing is a matter of arithmetic, not sentiment.  And the current arithmetic is outstanding.  The gold --"
9251,5,3,CERSEI,Is on its way.  My brother is supervising its transportation himself.
9252,5,3,TYCHO,Some at the Iron Bank will be disappointed.  They've grown rather fond of your interest payments.
9253,5,3,CERSEI,We must devise a way to raise their spirits.
9254,5,3,TYCHO,Yes.  Perhaps we could be of assistance in some current venture.
9255,5,3,CERSEI,My only venture at the moment is reestablishing control over this continent and every person on it.
9256,5,3,TYCHO,I see a great deal of potential in that venture.  I imagine that it would require outside investment?
9257,5,3,CERSEI,"It will indeed.  I need to expand my armies, my navies.  My hand, Qyburn, had made overtures to the Golden Company in Essos."
9258,5,3,TYCHO,I know them well.  They've helped us recover significant sums from parties who had fallen into deep arrears.
9259,5,3,CERSEI,That's good to hear.  I too would like them to recover some things that belong to me.
9260,5,3,TYCHO,"Rest assured, Your Grace, you can count on the Iron Bank's support, as soon as the gold arrives."
9261,5,3,TO,WINTERFELL - BRAN'S QUARTERS BRAN is sitting in a wheelchair.  PETER BAELISH is sitting next to him.  BAELISH unsheathes a Valyrian steel dagger and shows it to BRAN.  It's the same dagger used in the attempt to assassinate BRAN years ago.
9262,5,3,BAELISH,This is for you. BAELISH flips the knife in his hand and extends it towards BRAN.
9263,5,3,BAELISH,"The last man who wielded it meant to cut your throat, but your mother fought him off. BRAN reaches out and takes the knife, turning it and looking it over carefully."
9264,5,3,BAELISH,"The other dagger, the one that took her life, I would have stopped that dagger with my own heart if I could have.  I wasn't there for her when she needed me most.  But I am here for her now.  To do what she would have done, to protect her children.  Anything I can do for you, Brandon, you need only ask."
9265,5,3,BRAN,Do you know who this belonged to?
9266,5,3,BAELISH,"No.  That very question was what started the War of the Five Kings.  In a way, that dagger made you what you are today.  Forced from your home, driven out to the wilds beyond the Wall.  I imagine you've seen things most men wouldn't believe. BAELISH hands the sheath of the knife to BRAN.  BRAN slides the knife into the sheath."
9267,5,3,BAELISH,"To go through all of that and make your way home again only to find such chaos in the world, I can only imagine --"
9268,5,3,BRAN,Chaos is a ladder. BRAN is staring at BAELISH.  BAELISH stops speaking.  The door opens and Meera appears.
9269,5,3,BAELISH,"I'm sorry to have disturbed you, Lord Stark. BAELISH stands up to leave."
9270,5,3,BRAN,I'm not Lord Stark. BAELISH bows and walks past Meera and closes the door. MEERA notices BRAN sitting in a wheelchair.
9271,5,3,MEERA,What's that?
9272,5,3,BRAN,Maester Wolkan built it for me so I can move around more easily.
9273,5,3,MEERA,It's a very good idea.
9274,5,3,BRAN,You're leaving?
9275,5,3,MEERA,"I don't want to leave you, but when they come I need to be with my family.  And you're safe, safe as anyone can be now.  You don't need me anymore."
9276,5,3,BRAN,"No, I don't."
9277,5,3,MEERA,That's all you've got to say?
9278,5,3,BRAN,Thank you.
9279,5,3,MEERA,Thank you?
9280,5,3,BRAN,For helping me.
9281,5,3,MEERA,My brother died for you.  Hodor and Summer died for you.  I almost died for you.  Bran!
9282,5,3,BRAN,"I'm not really, not anymore.  I remember what it felt like to be Brandon Stark, but I remember so much else now. MEERA begins to cry."
9283,5,3,MEERA,"You died in that cave. MEERA turns to walk out the door.  She hesitates looking at BRAN, then walks out."
9284,5,3,TO,EXT WINTERFELL: There is a snow blown field.  ARYA is riding on a horse.  Winterfell can be seen far in the distance.
9285,5,3,TO,"EXT. WINTERFELL - GATE ARYA approaches the main gate on foot.  Two guards are huddled by a brazier getting warm.  There's indistinct chatter.  One of the men notice ARYA walking to the gate and approach her. MAN 1:  Hey, oh.  Where are you going?"
9286,5,3,ARYA,In there.  I live here. MAN 1:  Fuck off.
9287,5,3,ARYA,I'm Arya Stark.  This is my home. Both men look at each and start laughing. MAN 1:  Arya Stark is dead.
9288,5,3,ARYA,Send for Maester Llewyn or Ser Rodrick.  They'll tell you who I am. MAN 2:  There's no Rodrick here. MAN 1:  Maester's name is Wolkan.
9289,5,3,ARYA,"Go ask Jon Snow then, the King in the North.  He's my brother MAN 1:  He's a thousand miles away. MAN 2:  It's cold.  We're busy.  So, you know, best fuck off. MAN 1:  Mm-hmm."
9290,5,3,ARYA,"If Jon Snow is gone who is in charge of Winterfell? MAN 2:  The Lady of Winterfell, Lady Stark."
9291,5,3,ARYA,Which Lady Stark? MAN 1:  You tell us.  You're the one impersonating her sister.
9292,5,3,ARYA,"Tell Sansa her sister is home. MAN 1:  Lady Sansa is too busy to waster her breath on you, just like us.  So for the last time, fuck off. MAN 1 goes to grab Arya but she easily dodges out of his grasp."
9293,5,3,ARYA,"I'm getting into this castle one way or another.  If I'm not who I say I am, I won't last long.  But if I am, and Sansa finds out that you turned me away... ARYA keeps glancing at the men.  They look uneasy.  They bring her inside of the gate.  They indicate towards a cart near the entrance. MAN 2:  You sit there.  Right there.  Don't move. Both guards have a conversation out of earshot of Arya. MAN 2:  Go tell Lady Stark.  I'll watch her. ARYA is glancing around Winterfell.  Men are working building tools and cutting wood.  ARYA looks over and sees a Winterfell flag sigil hanging from the wall.  The two guards are still arguing. MAN 1:  You tell her. MAN 2:  I'm not. MAN 1:  Because if you don't I'll hit you right in the fucking face as hard as I can. The guards turn around and ARYA is gone."
9294,5,3,TO,"INT. WINTERFELL - SANSA'S QUARTERS Sansa is sitting at a table reviewing documents.  The two guards are in Sansa's room explaining what happened. MAN 2:  We told her to wait.  We were standing right next to her. SANSA sighs. MAN 1:  When we turned around she had gone, My Lady.  She was nothing.  Some winter town girl. MAN 2:  She comes in asking for Ser Rodrick and Maester Llewyn. MAN 1:  Don't trouble yourself over it, My Lady.  We'll find her."
9295,5,3,SANSA,You don't have to.  I know where she is. CUT TO - WINTERFELL - CRYPTS ARYA is standing look at a statue of Ned Stark holding his sword.  ARYA hears a sound and turns to see SANSA approaching.  SANSA stops when she sees ARYA.
9296,5,3,ARYA,Do I have to call you Lady Stark now? SANSA hesitates for a moment.
9297,5,3,SANSA,Yes. SANSA begins smiling then walking towards ARYA.  SANSA reaches out and hugs ARYA.
9298,5,3,SANSA,You shouldn't have run from the guards.
9299,5,3,ARYA,I didn't run.  You need better guards. SANSA smirks at ARYA.
9300,5,3,ARYA,"It suits you, Lady Stark.  Jon left you in charge?"
9301,5,3,SANSA,"He did.  I hope he comes back soon.  I remember how happy he was to see me.  When he sees you, his heart will probably stop. Both girls turn and look at the statue of Ned Stark."
9302,5,3,ARYA,That doesn't look like him.  It should have been carved by someone who knew his face.
9303,5,3,SANSA,Everyone who knew his face is dead.
9304,5,3,ARYA,We're not. ARYA turns to face SANSA.
9305,5,3,ARYA,They say you killed Joffrey.  Did you?
9306,5,3,SANSA,I wish I had.
9307,5,3,ARYA,Me too.  I was angry when I heard someone else had done it.  However long my list got he was always first.
9308,5,3,SANSA,Your list?
9309,5,3,ARYA,Of people I'm going to kill. SANSA begins to laugh.  ARYA joins her.
9310,5,3,SANSA,How did you get back to Winterfell?
9311,5,3,ARYA,It's a long story.  I imagine yours is too.
9312,5,3,SANSA,Yes.  It's not a very pleasant one.
9313,5,3,ARYA,"Mine neither, but our stories aren't over yet."
9314,5,3,SANSA,"No, they're not. The girls both embrace again."
9315,5,3,SANSA,"Arya, Bran's home too. ARYA smiles and looks at SANSA.  SANSA doesn't smile back.  The smile fades from ARYA's face."
9316,5,3,TO,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE BRAN is sitting next to the Weirwood tree.  SANSA and ARYA approach.  BRAN turns to look at them.  BRAN begins speaking to ARYA.
9317,5,3,BRAN,You came home. ARYA steps forward and throws her arms around BRAN.  SANSA smiles in the background.  ARYA lets go and steps back.
9318,5,3,BRAN,I saw you at the crossroads.
9319,5,3,ARYA,You saw me?
9320,5,3,BRAN,I see quite a lot now.
9321,5,3,SANSA,Bran has visions.
9322,5,3,BRAN,I thought you might go to King's Landing.
9323,5,3,ARYA,So did I.
9324,5,3,SANSA,Why would you go back there?
9325,5,3,BRAN,Cersei is on her list of names. ARYA stares at BRAN.  ARYA turns to look at SANSA.
9326,5,3,SANSA,Who else is on your list?
9327,5,3,ARYA,Most of them are dead already. BRAN produces the Valyrian dagger that BAELISH gave him and unsheathes it.
9328,5,3,ARYA,Where did you get this?
9329,5,3,BRAN,Littlefinger gave it to me.
9330,5,3,ARYA,"Littlefinger, he's here? ARYA turns to look at SANSA."
9331,5,3,SANSA,He's declared for House Stark. SANSA steps up closer to BRAN and speaks to him.
9332,5,3,SANSA,Why would he give you a dagger?
9333,5,3,BRAN,He thought I'd want it.
9334,5,3,SANSA,Why?
9335,5,3,BRAN,Because it was meant to kill me.
9336,5,3,SANSA,The cutthroat after your fall?
9337,5,3,ARYA,Why would a cutthroat have a Valyrian steel dagger?
9338,5,3,BRAN,Someone very wealthy wanted me dead.
9339,5,3,SANSA,He's not a generous man.  He wouldn't give you anything unless he thought he was getting something back.
9340,5,3,BRAN,It doesn't matter.
9341,5,3,SANSA,What do you mean it doesn't matter?
9342,5,3,BRAN,I don't want it. BRAN holds the knife out to ARYA.  ARYA looks at BRAN.
9343,5,3,ARYA,Are you sure?  It's Valyrian steel.
9344,5,3,BRAN,It's wasted on a cripple. ARYA looks down at the dagger.  She steps forward and takes it from BRAN.
9345,5,3,TO,WINTERFELL - GATE ARYA is pushing BRAN in his wheelchair and SANSA is next to them.  The Stark children are walking back through the gate of Winterfell.  Men are milling around doing various jobs.  BRIENNE and PODRICK see the Stark children all back at Winterfell together.
9346,5,3,PODRICK,Catelyn Stark would be proud.  You kept your vow.
9347,5,3,BRIENNE,I did next to nothing.
9348,5,3,PODRICK,"You're too hard on yourself, My Lady."
9349,5,3,BRIENNE,I'm not a -- BRIENNE pauses for a moment.
9350,5,3,BRIENNE,"Thank you, Podrick."
9351,5,3,TO,DRAGONSTONE DAENERYS and MISSANDEI are walking along a path outside of Dragonstone followed by members of the Queensguard.
9352,5,3,MISSANDEI,"Your Grace, there's still no word from the Unsullied."
9353,5,3,DAENERYS,Soon.  They will come back to me.
9354,5,3,MISSANDEI,He better. DAENERYS stops and turns to look at MISSANDEI.  She then continues walking.
9355,5,3,DAENERYS,What happened? MISSANDEI begins smirking.
9356,5,3,MISSANDEI,Many things.
9357,5,3,DAENERYS,Many things? Jon Snow appears at the bottom of the path.
9358,5,3,JON,Your Grace. DAENERYS looks at MISSANDEI then her Queensguard.  She speaks in Valyrian and motions to her guard to stand down.
9359,5,3,DAENERYS,It's all right. DAENERYS descends the stairs with MISSANDEI and they begin walking with JON.  They walk along the beach until they reach a cave.  DAVOS is waiting for them with a lit torch.
9360,5,3,JON,I wanted you to see it before we start hacking it to bits. JON leads DAENERYS and MISSANDEI into the cave.  He lights a brazier and illuminates the Dragonglass along the walls.  He continues walking deeper into the cave.
9361,5,3,JON,"So this is it, all we'll ever need. DAENERYS is looking up at the walls of Dragonglass."
9362,5,3,JON,"There is something else I want to show your, Your Grace. JON and DAENERYS go to a further chamber in the cave.  There are murals painted on the walls of Dragonglass."
9363,5,3,JON,The Children of the Forest made these.
9364,5,3,DAENERYS,When?
9365,5,3,JON,A very long time ago.
9366,5,3,DAENERYS,They were right here standing where we're standing before there were Targaryens or Starks or Lannisters.  Maybe even before there were men.
9367,5,3,JON,No. DAENERYS stops looking at the walls and turns to look at JON.  JON walks to another wall and begins to examine the murals.  The murals depict Children of the Forest and the First Men standing together.
9368,5,3,JON,They were here together the Children and the First Men.
9369,5,3,DAENERYS,Doing what?  Fighting each other? JON takes DAENERYS by the arm and swings her torch to another part of the wall.  There is a mural of the Night King and White Walkers.
9370,5,3,DAENERYS,"They fought together against their common enemy.  Despite their differences, despite their suspicions, together.  We need to do the same if we're going to survive. JON and DAENERYS look back at the wall with the Night King."
9371,5,3,JON,Because the enemy is real.  It's always been real. DAENERYS turns to look at JON.
9372,5,3,DAENERYS,And you say you can't defeat them without my armies and my dragons?
9373,5,3,JON,"No, I don't think I can. DAENERYS steps forward closer to JON."
9374,5,3,DAENERYS,I will fight for you.  I will fight for the north...when you bend the knee.
9375,5,3,JON,"My people won't accept a southern ruler, not after everything they've suffered. DAENERYS steps even closer to JON until they're face to face."
9376,5,3,DAENERYS,"They will if their king does.  They chose you to lead them.  They chose you to protect them. Isn't their survival more important than your pride? JON and DAENERYS, DAVOS and MISSANDEI are walking out of the cave.  As they exit TYRION and VARYS are standing on the beach awaiting them.  DAENERYS begins addressing Tyrion."
9377,5,3,DAENERYS,What is it?
9378,5,3,TYRION,We took Casterly Rock.
9379,5,3,DAENERYS,That's very good to hear. TYRION and VARYS look at each other.  They aren't eager to deliver the bad news.
9380,5,3,DAENERYS,Isn't it?
9381,5,3,TO,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH The group are all walking along the beach.  Daenerys is displeased.
9382,5,3,DAVOS,You'll want to discuss this amongst yourselves.  Perhaps --
9383,5,3,DAENERYS,You will stay.  All my allies are gone.  They've been taken from me while I've been sitting here on this island.
9384,5,3,TYRION,We still have the largest army.
9385,5,3,DAENERYS,Who won't be able to eat because Cersei has taken all the food from the Reach.
9386,5,3,TYRION,"Call Grey Worm and the Unsullied back.  We still have enough ships to carry the Dothraki to the mainland.  Commit to the blockade of King's Landing.  We have a plan.  It's still the right plan. DAENERYS stops walking, turns and speaks harshly to Tyrion."
9387,5,3,DAENERYS,"The right plan?  Your strategy has lost us Dorne, the Iron Islands and the Reach."
9388,5,3,TYRION,If I've underestimated our enemies --
9389,5,3,DAENERYS,"Our enemies?  Your family, you mean.  Perhaps you don't want to hurt them after all. DAENERYS begins looking out to the ocean.  Three dragons are flying in the sky over the water."
9390,5,3,DAENERYS,Enough with the clever plans. DAENERYS turns back and looks at TYRION.
9391,5,3,DAENERYS,I have three large dragons.  I'm going to fly them to the Red Keep.
9392,5,3,TYRION,We've discussed this.
9393,5,3,DAENERYS,My enemies are in the Red Keep.  What kind of a queen am I if I'm not willing to risk my life to fight them?
9394,5,3,TYRION,A smart one. DAENERYS looks over to JON SNOW.
9395,5,3,DAENERYS,What do you think I should do?
9396,5,3,JON,I would never presume to --
9397,5,3,DAENERYS,I'm at war.  I'm losing. DAENERYS begins walking close to JON.
9398,5,3,DAENERYS,What do you think I should do? JON looks over the ocean at the dragons flying.
9399,5,3,JON,I never thought that dragons would exist again.  No one did.  The people who follow you know that you made something impossible happen.  Maybe that helps them believe that you can make other impossible things happen.  Build a world that's different from the shit one they've always known. JON glances back towards the dragons.
9400,5,3,JON,"But if you use them to melt castles and burn cities, you're not different.  You're just more of the same. DAENERYS looks back out to her dragons flying along the water."
9401,5,3,TO,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD BRIENNE and PODRICK are sparring.  BRIENNE kicks PODS foot out from under him and he lands face first in the dirt.
9402,5,3,BRIENNE,Don't lunge. PODRICK pushes himself back up and picks up his sword.  PODRICK attacks again.  Brienne blocks his blows and kicks his foot out again.
9403,5,3,BRIENNE,Don't go where your enemy leads you. ARYA is watching the sparring session from across the courtyard.  She begins to approach Brienne.
9404,5,3,BRIENNE,Up. BRIENNE begins striking at PODRICK while he blocks her blows.  BRIENNE hits PODRICK in the stomach with the hilt of her sword and PODRICK lands on the ground.
9405,5,3,BRIENNE,And don't --
9406,5,3,ARYA,Don't fight someone like her in the first place. PODRICK stands up and retrieves his sword.  ARYA walks closer to speak to BRIENNE.
9407,5,3,BRIENNE,Nice sword.  Very nice dagger. ARYA looks down at the Valyrian dagger and unsheathes it.  She approaches BRIENNE flipping the knife several times in her fingers.  BRIENNE takes the dagger and examines it. SANSA and BAELISH are walking along the upper section of the courtyard having a conversation.
9408,5,3,SANSA,If they haven't contributed the right amount of grain to the stores then I'm afraid they'll have to make due with -- SANSA sees ARYA in the courtyard speaking with BRIENNE and stops to watch her. ARYA(TO BRIENNE):  It's been awhile since I've trained.
9409,5,3,BRIENNE,"I can go and find the Master of Arms for you, My Lady."
9410,5,3,ARYA,He didn't beat the hound.  You did.  I want to train with you. BRIENNE chuckles.
9411,5,3,ARYA,"You swore to serve both of my mother's daughters, didn't you? BRIENNE nods her head in agreement."
9412,5,3,BRIENNE,"Move aside, Podrick. PODRICK backs away.  ARYA draws her sword, Needle."
9413,5,3,BRIENNE,"You can't use that, My Lady.  It's too small."
9414,5,3,ARYA,I won't cut you.  Don't worry. BRIENNE smirks and raises her sword to a fighting posture.
9415,5,3,BRIENNE,"I'll try not to. BRIENNE strikes at ARYA who quickly sidesteps and parries the attack.  BRIENNE attacks again and ARYA sidesteps, dodges multiple strikes and parries BRIENNE while smiling.  ARYA strikes at BRIENNE and hits her hand causing BRIENNE to flinch and lose her two-handed grip on her sword.  BRIENNE regains composure and starts to circle ARYA.  BAELISH and SANSA are still watching from the upper balcony.  ARYA is waiting for an attack with her sword behind her back.  BRIENNE strikes and ARYA blocks her attacks, spins and stabs behind her back and hits BRIENNE in the knee causing BRIENNE's sword to strike the dirt.  BRIENNE kicks ARYA in the stomach and sends ARYA to the ground.  ARYA quickly gets back to her feet.  BRIENNE overpowers ARYA and ARYA drops her sword on the ground.  BRIENNE strikes again but ARYA dodges, draws her Valyrian dagger and puts it near BRIENNE's neck.  BRIENNE and ARYA both stop fighting and sheathe their weapons smiling."
9416,5,3,BRIENNE,Who taught you to do that?
9417,5,3,ARYA,No one. ARYA collects her sword.  SANSA walks away.  BAELISH remains on the balcony staring at ARYA who looks up at him.  BAELISH bows to ARYA and walks away.
9418,5,3,TO,DRAGONSTONE JON and DAVOS are walking along the paths outside of Dragonstone having a discussion.
9419,5,3,DAVOS,What do you think of her?
9420,5,3,JON,Who? DAVOS sighs
9421,5,3,DAVOS,I believe you know of whom I speak.
9422,5,3,JON,I think she has a good heart.
9423,5,3,DAVOS,A good heart?  I've noticed you starring at that good heart.
9424,5,3,JON,"There's no time for that.  I saw the Night King, Davos.  I looked into his eyes.  How many men do we have in the north to fight him?  10,000?  Less?"
9425,5,3,DAVOS,Fewer.
9426,5,3,JON,What? DAVOS and JON near the end of the path.  MISSANDEI is standing along the path looking at the ocean.
9427,5,3,DAVOS,"Speaking of good hearts, Missandei of Naarth. MISSANDEI turns to looks at DAVOS and JON."
9428,5,3,MISSANDEI,"Ser Davos, Lord Snow."
9429,5,3,DAVOS,"King Snow, isn't it?  No?  That doesn't sound right.  King Jon?"
9430,5,3,JON,It doesn't matter.
9431,5,3,MISSANDEI,"Forgive me, but may I ask a question?"
9432,5,3,JON,Of course.
9433,5,3,MISSANDEI,"Your name is Jon Snow, but your father's name was Ned Stark?"
9434,5,3,JON,I'm a bastard.  My mother and father weren't married.
9435,5,3,DAVOS,Is the custom different in Naarth?
9436,5,3,MISSANDEI,We don't have marriage in Naarth so the concept of a bastard doesn't exist.
9437,5,3,DAVOS,The sounds liberating.
9438,5,3,JON,Why did you leave your homeland?
9439,5,3,MISSANDEI,I was stolen away by slavers.
9440,5,3,JON,I'm sorry.
9441,5,3,DAVOS,"If I may, how did a slave girl come to advise Daenerys Targaryen?"
9442,5,3,MISSANDEI,She bought me from my master and set me free.
9443,5,3,DAVOS,"That was good of her.  Of course you're serving her now, aren't you?"
9444,5,3,MISSANDEI,I serve my queen because I want to serve my queen.  Because I believe in her.
9445,5,3,JON,And if you wanted to sail home to Naarth tomorrow --
9446,5,3,MISSANDEI,Then she would give me a ship and wish me good fortune.
9447,5,3,JON,You believe that?
9448,5,3,MISSANDEI,"I know it.  All of us who came with her from Essos, we believe in her.  She's not our queen because she's the daughter of some king we never knew.  She's the queen we chose. DAVOS(to JON):  You'll forgive me if I switch sides. JON notices a single ship sailing into the bay.  It has a kraken sigil.  MISSANDEI turns to look."
9449,5,3,JON,Is that a Greyjoy ship?
9450,5,3,TO,"DRAGONSTONE - BEACH THEON GREYJOY and other Iron Born are pulling their landing boat onto the beach wading through the surf.  They pull the boat onto the sand.  JON SNOW, MISSANDEI, DAVOS and Dothraki guards are waiting to meet them.  JON sees THEON and both men freeze and stare at each other.  JON steps forward towards THEON."
9451,5,3,THEON,Jon.  I didn't know you were here. THEON steps closer to JON.
9452,5,3,THEON,"Sansa, is she all right? JON grabs THEON by his shirt and pulls him face to face."
9453,5,3,JON,What you did for her is the only reason I'm not killing you. JON releases THEON.
9454,5,3,DAVOS,We heard your uncle attacked your fleet.  We thought you were dead.
9455,5,3,THEON,I should be.
9456,5,3,DAVOS,Your sister?
9457,5,3,THEON,Euron has her.  I came to ask the queen to help get her back.
9458,5,3,JON,The queen is gone.
9459,5,3,THEON,Where did she go?
9460,5,3,TO,KING'S LANDING - FIELDS The Lannister army is returning from sacking Highgarden.  They are delivering gold and food to King's Landing.  There are carts and men that haven't made it into the city gates yet.  JAIME and BRONN are supervising the procession.  RANDYLL TARLEY comes riding up on his horse.
9461,5,3,RANDYLL,All of the gold is safely through the gates of King's Landing.
9462,5,3,JAIME,Good.
9463,5,3,RANDYLL,"We need to get the last of these wagons over the Blackwater Rush before nightfall.  If the head of the line is ambushed, the tail will never be able to reinforce in time."
9464,5,3,JAIME,We are stretched a bit thin.
9465,5,3,RANDYLL,"With your permission, flogging stragglers has a marked effect on mobility."
9466,5,3,JAIME,"Let's give them fair warning first.  These men fought well at Highgarden. RANDYLL is clearly disappointed.  He turns and rides off back to the line of soldiers.  JAIME and BRONN exchange glances, then follow RANDYLL.  BRONN and JAIME are riding through the ranks.  DICKON TARLEY sees JAIME and starts a conversation."
9467,5,3,DICKON,Ser Jaime.
9468,5,3,JAIME,Rickon.
9469,5,3,DICKON,Dickon. BRONN openly laughs in DICKON's face and looks at JAIME.
9470,5,3,JAIME,I hear you fought bravely at Highgarden.  Your first battle? DICKON nods his head in agreement.
9471,5,3,JAIME,And?
9472,5,3,DICKON,It was glorious.
9473,5,3,BRONN,Come on.  Your father's not here.
9474,5,3,DICKON,All my life we've been pledged to House Tyrell.  I knew some of those men.  I hunted with them.
9475,5,3,JAIME,They didn't deserve to die.  But Lady Olenna chose to betray the queen and support the Targaryen girl.  So here we are.
9476,5,3,DICKON,I didn't expect it to smell like that.
9477,5,3,BRONN,Men shit themselves when they die.  Didn't they teach you that at fancy lad school? JAIME looks over at BRONN
9478,5,3,BRONN,"Well, I learned it when I was 5. BRONN pauses and strains to hear a noise far in the distance."
9479,5,3,JAIME,What?
9480,5,3,BRONN,Listen. Horses and high pitched war cries are heard  beyond the hill in the distance.  JAIME takes off at a gallop yelling orders to the soldiers on the road.
9481,5,3,JAIME,Spears and shields!  Spears and shields! The men jump into action and start arming themselves.
9482,5,3,JAIME,Spears and shields!
9483,5,3,BRONN,In line now! RANDYLL is riding across the battlefield yelling orders to men.
9484,5,3,RANDYLL,"Come on, lads.  Not those wagons.  Fall in line.  Fall in line. The Lannister army gets in formation to repel the invading horde.   Lannister archers line up behind the pikemen.  The horde is drawing closer.  The Dothraki come riding over the hill with curved swords held overhead and screaming.  There are a thousand of them or more. DICKON draws his sword.  RANDYLL is yelling orders to the men."
9485,5,3,RANDYLL,Spears armed! The Lannister pikemen drop their spears into a fighting position and ready their shields.  BRONN rides up to JAIME.
9486,5,3,BRONN,Get back to King's Landing.
9487,5,3,JAIME,I'm not abandoning my army.
9488,5,3,BRONN,"You're a commander, not a damned infantryman.  These fuckers are about to swamp us."
9489,5,3,JAIME,We can hold them off. A dragon can be heard roaring in the distance.  DAENERYS and DROGON come flying over the Dothraki and over the battlefield.  DAENERYS commands DROGON to attack.
9490,5,3,DAENERYS,Dracarys! DROGON breathes fire into the first line of Lannister soldiers.  The men burst into flames and start screaming.  DICKON looks on in shock.  A flanking group of Dothraki Screamers ride over the flames through the hole created by Drogon and start cutting men down.  JAIME attempts to issue orders to the men.
9491,5,3,JAIME,"Hold the line! The main force of Dothraki crashes into shielded pikemen.  Men on both sides are being slaughtered.  A second wave of Dothraki Screamers ride in.  They switch from a seated position to standing atop their saddles shooting bow and arrow.  The Lannister archers fire back and many men are killed.  DAENERYS and DROGON circle around and billow flames across the battlefield.  DAENERYS steers DROGON down the King's Road.  DROGON spews flames and destroys the carriages along the road.  Carts are exploding into pieces, barrels are flying through the air.  JAIME is looking at the carnage in astonishment."
9492,5,3,JAIME,Archers!  Archers with me! A group of archers break from the main battle and follow JAIME and BRONN.  JAIME lines the men up to counter DAENERYS and DROGON.
9493,5,3,JAIME,Knock!
9494,5,3,ARCHERS,Knock!  Draw! DROGON loops around and is making a pass on JAIME and the archers.  DAENERYS and DROGON are diving at the group of men.
9495,5,3,JAIME,Loose! The archers fire their arrows in unison.  DAENERYS sees the projectiles and turns Drogon so the arrows bounce harmlessly off his breast.  She makes a run on another line of carriages and DROGON burns them in a single breath.  Men are screaming and catching on fire.  JAIME and BRONN survey the damage.
9496,5,3,JAIME,Qyburn's scorpion is over there.
9497,5,3,BRONN,Go get it then.
9498,5,3,JAIME,I can't shoot with one hand. JAIME holds up his gold hand to illustrate his point. BRONN hesitates for a moment.  He turns his horse and rides to man the artillery crossbow.  JAIME draws his sword and rides into battle.
9499,5,3,JAIME,"Come on! A Dothraki screamer wielding two swords charges JAIME.  JAIME is blocking the attacks but is getting overpowered.  DICKON stabs the screamer through his back.  JAIME nods at DICKON.  BRONN is making his way to the crossbow.  A Dothraki screamer sees him and charges.  BRONN reaches behind him and retrieves a small sword.  He throws the sword at the Dothraki but the screamer parries it.  BRONN draws his primary sword and the two men charge at each other.  As BRONN is about to strike, the screamer leans over and cuts BRONN's horse's leg off causing BRONN to fall to the ground.  BRONN's bag of gold hits the ground and splits open.  The screamer is turning his horse around and is about to attack BRONN again.  BRONN abandons the gold and runs into the mayhem trying to lose the mounted rider.  BRONN pushes a flaming Lannister soldier out of the way.  He pulls a sword out of a dead man and uses it to start fighting Dothraki.  DROGON flies overhead and spews flames through the air.  BRONN manages to escape the mounted rider and disappear into the fog.  The screamer dismounts and continues the search on foot.  The screamer climbs onto a covered wagon to check for BRONN.  When he pulls the canvas back he see's BRONN behind the crossbow with a bolt pointed at him.  BRONN fires the bolt and impales the Dothraki screamer.  BRONN pulls a lever and the sides of the wagon drop down revealing the crossbow.  BRONN reloads the weapon and begins making adjustments to line up a shot on DROGON."
9500,5,3,BRONN,Where are you? TYRION walks to the edge of the battlefield accompanied by Dothraki guards.  He can see Lannisters being slaughtered.  One of the Dothraki guards begin to speak.
9501,5,3,GUARD,Your people can't fight. TYRION is watching the mayhem.  Men are screaming and engulfed in flames.  Horses and carriages run wild with no driver.  JAIME is still on the battlefield struggling against the horde.  Burning Lannister men are taking off their helmets revealing melted faces.  Men crawl to the river in search of relief from the dragonfire.  DROGON and DAENERYS are flying over the river creating wake in the water.  JAIME sees her approaching his position.
9502,5,3,JAIME,Take cover! DROGON spits flames into the Lannister position.  The men standing there are reduced to standing ash.  The wind blows them away.  BRONN is lining up DROGON in the sights of the crossbow.  He reaches down and pulls the lever to fire.  A bolt sails past DROGON and misses.  BRONN reloads the machine.  DROGON and DAENERYS circle around and dive on the crossbow.  BRONN takes his time aiming his shot.
9503,5,3,BRONN,Come on you fucker. DAENERYS commands DROGON to fire at the crossbow.
9504,5,3,DAENERYS,"Dracarys! Before DROGON can send flames, BRONN fires a bolt that strikes DROGON in the wing.  DROGON begins to pinwheel out of control towards the ground.  BRONN is smiling.  He whips the machine around and begins reloading.  DAENERYS and DROGON are falling from the sky.  DROGON regains control and begins hovering over the river.  BRONN realizes he doesn't have time to reload and dives out of the way of the incoming dragonfire.  DROGON spits flames at the machine and instantly destroys it.  Flames lick over BRONN but he is uninjured.  DROGON is forced to land on the edge of the river due to his wound.  DAENERYS climbs from her mount and rushes to pull the spear from DROGON's wing.  JAIME is 100 yards from DAENERYS watching her.  She is all alone.  JAIME sees a spear sticking out of a dead man.  TYRION spots JAIME across the battlefield."
9505,5,3,TYRION,"Flee, you idiot! JAIME looks at DAENERYS and readies himself.  He spurs his horse onward."
9506,5,3,JAIME,"Come on, boy.  Come on! JAIME grabs the spear as he rides by and brings it up to position.  JAIME's horse is galloping full speed on the edge of the river kicking up water.  TYRION is watching JAIME's attempt to kill DAENERYS."
9507,5,4,DEFAULT,Eastwatch (Script) Lyrics EPISODE 5 - EASTWATCH TITLE SEQUENCE EXT. KING'S LANDING - RIVER Smoke and fire are seen in the distance across the river.  BRONN breaks the surface of the water and takes a breath.  He pulls JAIME up and JAIME gasps for breath.  BRONN helps JAIME to the shore and drops him to the ground and collapses next to him.  JAIME coughs up water and continues struggling on the ground to breathe.  Both men roll onto their backs and gasp for air.
9508,5,4,JAIME,You could have killed me.
9509,5,4,BRONN,What the fuck were you doing back there?
9510,5,4,JAIME,Ending the war by killing her.
9511,5,4,BRONN,You saw the dragon between you and her? BRONN looks incredulously at JAIME.
9512,5,4,BRONN,And? JAIME sits up and says nothing to BRONN.  BRONN sits up and faces JAIME.
9513,5,4,BRONN,"Listen to me, cunt.  Till I get what I'm owed, a dragon doesn't get to kill you.  You don't get to kill you.  Only I get to kill you."
9514,5,4,JAIME,"That was only one of them.  She has two more.  If she decides to use them, to really use them --"
9515,5,4,BRONN,You're fucked.
9516,5,4,JAIME,Don't you mean we're fucked?
9517,5,4,BRONN,"No, I do not.  Dragons are where our partnership ends.  I'm not going to be around when those things start spitting fire on King's Landing."
9518,5,4,JAIME,I have to tell Cersei. BRONN pauses and looks at JAIME.
9519,5,4,BRONN,Best well jump back in that river. BRONN stands up and walks away.  JAIME continues sitting on the shore looking at the smoke and fire from the distant battle.
9520,5,4,TO,KING'S LANDING - BATTLEGROUND TYRION is walking over an ash covered ground.  There are burned bodies and cargo strewn about.  Dothraki are looting dead Lannister soldies.  A group of mounted Dothraki are escorting captured Lannister soldiers to where DAENERYS and DROGON are awaiting the prisoners.  DAENERYS addresses the captured soldiers.
9521,5,4,DAENERYS,"I know what Cersei has told you, that I've come to destroy your cities -- The camera pans around the prisoners.  The men are covered in filth and blood from the battle."
9522,5,4,DAENERYS,"-- burn down your homes, murder you and orphan your children.  That's Cersei Lannister, not me.  I'm not here to murder.  And all I want to destroy is the wheel that is rolled over rich and poor to the benefit of no one but the Cersei Lannisters of the world.  I offer you a choice.  Bend the knee and join me.  Together we will leave the world a better place than we found it, or refuse and die. A few Lannister men kneel to the ground, while most remain standing.  DROGON roars and moves closer to the men.  Almost all the Lannister men quickly kneel while a few still remain standing including RANDYLL and DICKON TARLEY.  DAENERYS speaks to RANDYLL."
9523,5,4,DAENERYS,"Step forward, My Lord. RANDYLL takes several steps towards DAENERYS and stands in front of the kneeling Lannister men."
9524,5,4,DAENERYS,You will not kneel?
9525,5,4,RANDYLL,I already have a queen.
9526,5,4,TYRION,"My sister, she wasn't your queen until recently though, was she, until she murdered your rightful queen and destroyed House Tyrell for all time.  So it appears your allegiances are somewhat flexible."
9527,5,4,RANDYLL,"There are no easy choices in war.  Say what you will about your sister, she was born in Westeros, has lived here all her life.  You on the other hand, you murdered your own father and chose to support a foreign invader.  One with no ties to this land, an army of savages at her back."
9528,5,4,DAENERYS,You will not trade your honor for your life.  I respect that. TYRION turns to speak to DAENERYS.
9529,5,4,TYRION,"Perhaps he could take the black, Your Grace.  Whatever else he is, he is a true soldier.  He would be invaluable at the Wall."
9530,5,4,RANDYLL,You cannot send me to the Wall.  You are not my queen. DAENERYS turns to look at her Dothraki escort.  The Dothraki walk forward to collect RANDYLL.  As the men are pulling RANDYLL away DICKON steps forward.
9531,5,4,DICKON,You will have to kill me too. RANDYLL pulls away from the Dothraki and turns to face his son.
9532,5,4,RANDYLL,Step back and shut your mouth. DAENERYS(to DICKON):  Who are you?
9533,5,4,RANDYLL,A stupid boy.
9534,5,4,DICKON,"I'm Dickon Tarley, son of Randyll Tarley."
9535,5,4,TYRION,You are the future of your house.  This war has already wiped one great house from the world.  Don't let it happen again.  Bend the knee. DICKON looks to RANDYLL.  RANDYLL nods to his son.
9536,5,4,DICKON,I will not. TYRION turns to speak to DAENERYS.  He speaks softly so no one but the queen can hear.
9537,5,4,TYRION,"Your Grace, nothing strips bold notions from a man's head like a few weeks in a dark cell."
9538,5,4,DAENERYS,I meant what I said.  I'm not here to put men in chains.  If that becomes an option many will take it.  I gave them a choice.  They made it.
9539,5,4,TYRION,"Your Grace, if you begin beheading entire families --"
9540,5,4,DAENERYS,I'm not beheading anyone. TYRION pauses and looks over the DROGON.  DRGON roars and shakes his head and flexes his wings.
9541,5,4,TYRION,Your Grace -- DAENERYS looks to her Dothraki escort and gives a signal.  The men grab RANDYLL and DICKON and walk them over to DROGON.  RANDYLL takes DICKON by the arm.
9542,5,4,DAENERYS,"Lord Randyll Tarley, Dickon Tarley, I, Daenerys of House Targaryen, First of my name, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons, sentence you to die. DAENERYS pauses a moment and looks at RANDYLL and DICKON."
9543,5,4,DAENERYS,Dracarys. DROGON draws a deep breath and begins spewing dragonfire at the two men.  They are instantly engulfed in flames.  They both collapse into ash after a few seconds.  There are two craters left where RANDYLL and DICKON stood.  The Lannister men recoil in horror.  Any Lannister soldier that was still standing kneels to the ground.  DAENERYS silently turns and begins to walk off the battlefield.
9544,5,4,TO,"KING'S LANDING - HALLWAY JAIME is quickly walking down the hall leading to CERSEI's room.  As he approaches, QYBURN exits the queen's chambers."
9545,5,4,QYBURN,My Lord. JAIME passes by QYBURN without saying a word and barges into CERSEI's quarters.  CERSEI stand and walks over to JAIME.
9546,5,4,CERSEI,How many men did we lose?
9547,5,4,JAIME,We haven't done a full counting.
9548,5,4,CERSEI,"It's armies that win wars.  We have the Tyrell gold, we have the Iron Bank behind us.  We can buy mercenaries. JAIME shakes his head."
9549,5,4,CERSEI,"They're not the same as our men but they'll fight if they're well paid, which they will be."
9550,5,4,JAIME,"I just saw the Dothraki fight.  They'll beat any mercenary army.  They'll beat any army I've ever seen.  Killing our men wasn't war for them, it was sport.  Her dragon burned a thousand wagons.  Qyburn's scorpion fired bolts bigger than you.  They couldn't stop it.  And she has three of them.  This isn't a war we can win."
9551,5,4,CERSEI,"So what do we do?  Sue for peace?  I sit on her father's throne, the father you betrayed and murdered.  And in her mind she's winning.  What sort of offer do you think she'd make? CERSEI turns and walks away from JAIME."
9552,5,4,CERSEI,Maybe we can count on Tyrion to intercede on our behalf by way of apology for murdering our father and our son.
9553,5,4,JAIME,He didn't.
9554,5,4,CERSEI,"You saw the crossbow, you saw his body. JAIME walks across the room to where CERSEI is standing."
9555,5,4,JAIME,I'm not talking about father.  Tyrion didn't kill Joffrey.  He had nothing to do with it.
9556,5,4,CERSEI,After all this time it still amazes me --
9557,5,4,JAIME,It was Olenna.  She confessed before she died.
9558,5,4,CERSEI,And this was before or after she drank the poison you so kindly provided her?
9559,5,4,JAIME,After.
9560,5,4,CERSEI,And you believed her?
9561,5,4,JAIME,"If you were Olenna would you rather have seen your granddaughter married to Joffrey or Tommen?  Which one would Margerey been better able to control?  Which one would have made Olenna the true ruler of the Seven Kingdoms?  She was telling the truth. CERSEI looks away, then sits down."
9562,5,4,CERSEI,I shouldn't have listened to you.  She should have died screaming.
9563,5,4,JAIME,"She's dead like her son, her grandchildren, her whole house.  And if we don't find a way out of this war we'll follow them."
9564,5,4,CERSEI,So we fight and die or we submit and die.  I know my choice.  A soldier should know his.
9565,5,4,TO,EXT. DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS JON SNOW is standing on the edge of a cliff looking towards the ocean.   DROGON roars and flies over him with DAENERYS on his back.  DROGON lands next to JON and charges towards him.  DROGON opens his jaws and roars in JON's face.  DROGON creeps closer until he is inches  from JON.  JON removes his glove and slowly extends his hand toward DROGON.  DROGON lowers his head and allows JON to touch him.  DAENERYS  looks surprised and steps down from her mount.  DROGON turns and flies away.
9566,5,4,DAENERYS,"They're beautiful, aren't they?"
9567,5,4,JON,"That wasn't the word I was thinking of, but, yes, they are.  Gorgeous beasts."
9568,5,4,DAENERYS,"They're not beasts to me.  No matter how big they get, how terrifying to everyone else, they're my children. DAENERYS turns to look at her three dragons as they fly over Dragonstone in the distance."
9569,5,4,JON,You weren't gone long. DAENERYS turns back to JON.
9570,5,4,DAENERYS,No.
9571,5,4,JON,And?
9572,5,4,DAENERYS,And I have fewer enemies today than I did yesterday. JON pauses and doesn't say anything.
9573,5,4,DAENERYS,You're not sure how you feel about that?
9574,5,4,JON,"No, I'm not. DAENERYS turns and starts walking towards the castle, JON follows."
9575,5,4,DAENERYS,How many men did your army kill taking Winterfell back from the Boltons?
9576,5,4,JON,Thousands.
9577,5,4,DAENERYS,We both want to help people.  We can only help them from a position of strength.  Sometimes strength is terrible.  When you first came here Ser Davos said you took a knife in the heart for your people.
9578,5,4,JON,Ser Davos gets carried away.
9579,5,4,DAENERYS,So it was a figure of speech? JON doesn't say anything.  A group of Dothraki guards approach DAENERYS and speak in their native tongue.
9580,5,4,GUARD,"This man says he is your friend, Khaleesi. The guard steps to the side and JORAH MORMONT stands behind him.  DAENERYS answers the guard in Dothraki."
9581,5,4,DAENERYS,He is my friend. JORAH kneels before DAENERYS.
9582,5,4,JORAH,Your Grace. JORAH stands.
9583,5,4,DAENERYS,"Jon Snow, this is Ser Jorah Mormont, an old friend."
9584,5,4,JON,I served with your father.  He was a great man. JORAH nods to JON.
9585,5,4,DAENERYS,You look strong.  You found a cure?
9586,5,4,JORAH,"I wouldn't be here if I hadn't.  I return to your service, my queen, if you'll have me."
9587,5,4,DAENERYS,It would be my honor. DAENERYS steps forward and hugs JORAH.
9588,5,4,TO,EXT. WINTERFELL A group of ravens are resting on a tree.  Several of the ravens' eyes wash white.  They take off and fly over Winterfell.  They cross frozen fields and over a snowy mountain.  They arrive at The Wall at Eastwatch-by-the-sea and continue over the Wall.  The ravens fly many miles over tundra and more mountains.  The birds crest a hill and thousands of dead men can be seen marching south.  A group of riders and the Night King are on top of an outcrop watching the dead file past.  As the ravens approach the Night King peers in their direction and the birds scatter and disperse.
9589,5,4,TO,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE BRAN's eyes are pure white.  They wash back to their normal color.  He is sitting in front of the Weirwood.  Maester Wolkan stands next to him.
9590,5,4,BRAN,Ravens.  We need to send ravens. WOLKAN nods his head to BRAN.
9591,5,4,TO,"CITADEL - MAESTER COUNCIL CHAMBER ARCHMAESTER MARWYN and other citadel maesters are seated at a council table.  MARWYN has a raven scroll in his hand and the maesters are discussing the contents.  SAMWELL enters the room carrying a large stock of books and scrolls.  MARWYN points SAM to a nearby table to offload the books. MAESTER 1:  I put very little stock in it myself.  Prophecies of doom are never in short supply, especially when winter comes."
9592,5,4,MARWYN,"I remember Wolkan.   A bit timid but a sharp mind. MAESTER 1:  The north has dulled many good maester's wits.  I'm not sure if it's the cold, the drink, or the company. All the maesters chuckle. MAESTER 1:  A crippled boy claims to have seen dead men on the march beyond the wall thanks to the magical help of a raven with three eyes. SAM stops working and turns around."
9593,5,4,MARWYN,It is a bit much.  Still we ought to --
9594,5,4,SAMWELL,Brandon Stark -- The maesters all turn in their seats to look at SAMWELL.
9595,5,4,SAMWELL,-- the crippled boy.
9596,5,4,MARWYN,Do you know him?
9597,5,4,SAMWELL,I let him through the Wall years ago.  I saw him go beyond the wall.
9598,5,4,MARWYN,And?
9599,5,4,SAMWELL,"Somehow a crippled boy survived for years beyond the wall when no one else could.  Not the Night's Watch, not the Wildlings, no one.  Perhaps we ought to listen to what he has to say. MAESTER 1:  Perhaps you need more scribing work to discipline your mind."
9600,5,4,MARWYN,I sense a more detailed proposal is forthcoming. SAMWELL steps forward and clears his throat.
9601,5,4,SAMWELL,"Everyone in Westeros trusts and respects you.  If you tell people the threat is real they'll believe it.  If you advise all the lords to send their men north to hold the wall they'll do it.  And if you tell every maester in the Citadel to search every word of every faded scroll about the long night, they may find something that lets us defeat the Army of the Dead for good."
9602,5,4,MARWYN,It could be done.  And this news could be authentic.  It's possible.  It's also possible this message is part of a ploy by the dragon queen to lure southern armies away from the lands they are currently defending to open those lands to easy conquest. MAESTER 1:  That does seem far more likely than magic birds talking to cripples.
9603,5,4,SAMWELL,"Archmaester, please.  It's real.  I've seen it."
9604,5,4,MARWYN,We will write to Maester Wolkan at Winterfell for clarification.  I promise you we will get to the truth of it one way or another.
9605,5,4,SAMWELL,Archmaester --
9606,5,4,MARWYN,"That will be all, Tarley. SAM turns to collect his work and leave.  The maesters begin talking to one another. MAESTER 2:  It brings to mind the work of Davy Moonstone, the charlatan who claimed to see the children of the forest. The maesters all chuckle. MAESTER 1:  Don't forget the Prophet Lodock that promised the Drowned God would rise up and destroy Aegon the Conquerer. The maesters continue laughing.  SAMWELL gets the last of his work and walks out of the door in disgust.  MAESTER 1 turns to look at MARWYN. MAESTER 1:  Is he the one whose father and brother were just burned alive?"
9607,5,4,MARWYN,I'm afraid so. MAESTER 2:  Horrible business.
9608,5,4,MARWYN,I don't have the heart to tell him yet.  He's a good lad. MARWYN crumples the raven scroll and throws it dismissevely on the table.
9609,5,4,MARWYN,Right.  The ravenry was falling apart last time I checked...
9610,5,4,TO,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM VARYS and TYRION are sitting on the stairs of the Throne Room alone.  VARYS has a sealed raven scroll in his hand tapping it on the stone.  TYRION is drinking a glass of wine having a discussion with VARYS.
9611,5,4,TYRION,All rulers demand that people bend the knee.  It's why they're rulers.  She gave Tarley a choice.  A man who had taken up arms against her.  What else could she do?
9612,5,4,VARYS,Not burn him alive alongside his son.
9613,5,4,TYRION,"I am her hand, not her head.  I can't make her decisions for her."
9614,5,4,VARYS,"That's what I used to tell myself about her father.  I found the traitors but I wasn't the one burning them alive.  I was only a purveyor of information. VARYS reaches over to TYRION's cup of wine, picks it up and begins to drink from it.  He grimaces as he drinks."
9615,5,4,VARYS,"It's what I told myself when I watched them beg for mercy, ""I'm not the one doing it.""  As the pitch of their screams rose higher, ""I'm not the one doing it.""  When their hair caught fire and the smell of the burning flesh filled the Thone Room, ""I'm not the one doing it."" VARYS drinks again and sets the cup down next to TYRION.  TYRION picks it up."
9616,5,4,TYRION,Daenerys is not her father.
9617,5,4,VARYS,And she never will be... with the right counsel.  You need to find a way to make her listen. TYRION looks down at the note in VARYS's hand.
9618,5,4,TYRION,Who is that for?
9619,5,4,VARYS,Jon Snow.
9620,5,4,TYRION,Did you read it?
9621,5,4,VARYS,It's a sealed scroll for the King in the North. TYRION pauses and drinks from his cup of wine.
9622,5,4,TYRION,What's it say?
9623,5,4,VARYS,Nothing good.
9624,5,4,TO,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE DAENERYS and VARYS are seated at the painted table.  TYRION and JORAH stand near the queen.  DAVOS and JON SNOW are standing on the other end of the table.  JON is holding a raven scroll and reading it.
9625,5,4,JON,I thought Arya was dead.  I thought Bran was dead.
9626,5,4,DAENERYS,I'm happy for you.  You don't look happy.
9627,5,4,JON,Bran saw the Night King and his army marching towards Eastwatch.  If they make it past the wall --
9628,5,4,VARYS,The Wall has kept them out for thousands of years.  Presumably -- JON interrupts VARYS.
9629,5,4,JON,I need to go home.
9630,5,4,DAENERYS,You said you don't have enough men.
9631,5,4,JON,We'll fight with the men we have.  Unless you'll join us.
9632,5,4,DAENERYS,And give the country to Cersei?  As soon as I march away she marches in.
9633,5,4,TYRION,Perhaps not.  Cersei thinks the Army of the Dead is nothing but a story made up by wet nurses to frighten children.  What if we prove her wrong?
9634,5,4,JON,I don't think she'll come see the dead at my invitation. TYRION begins walking around the table closer to JON.
9635,5,4,TYRION,So bring the dead to her.
9636,5,4,DAENERYS,I thought that was what we are trying to avoid.
9637,5,4,TYRION,We don't have to bring the whole army.  Only one soldier. DAVOS(to JON):  Is that possible?
9638,5,4,JON,The first White I ever saw was brought into Castle Black from beyond the Wall.
9639,5,4,TYRION,Bring one of these things down to King's Landing and show her the truth.
9640,5,4,VARYS,Anything you bring back will be useless unless Cersei grants us an audience and is somehow convinced not to murder us the moment we set foot in the capital.
9641,5,4,TYRION,The only person she listens to is Jaime.  He may listen to me.
9642,5,4,DAENERYS,And how would you get into King's Landing. Everyone in the room stops and looks at DAVOS.
9643,5,4,DAVOS,"I can smuggle you in, but if the Goldcloaks were to recognize you, I'm warning you, I'm not a fighter. TYRION nods his head."
9644,5,4,DAENERYS,"Well, it will all be for nothing if we don't have one of these dead men."
9645,5,4,VARYS,Fair point.  How do you propose to find one? JON pauses and stares at the ground.  JORAH breaks the silence.
9646,5,4,JORAH,With the queen's permission I'll go north and take one. DAENERYS turns to look at JORAH.
9647,5,4,JORAH,You asked me to find a cure so I could serve you.  Allow me to serve you.
9648,5,4,JON,The free folk will help us.  They know the real north better than anyone.
9649,5,4,DAVOS,They won't follow Ser Jorah.
9650,5,4,JON,They won't have to.
9651,5,4,DAVOS,You can't lead a raid beyond the wall.  You're not in the Night's Watch anymore.  You're King in the North.
9652,5,4,JON,I'm the only one here whose fought them.  I'm the only one here who knows them.
9653,5,4,DAENERYS,I haven't given you permission to leave.
9654,5,4,JON,"With respect, Your Grace, I don't need your permission.  I am a king.  And I came here knowing that you could have your men behead me or your dragons burn me alive.  I put my trust in you, a stranger, because I knew it was the best chance for my people, for all our people.  Now I'm asking you to trust in a stranger because it's our best chance. DAENERYS pauses for a moment then nods her head in agreement."
9655,5,4,TO,"WINTERFELL - THE GREAT HALL Northen lords including ROBETT GLOVER, YOHN ROYCE and LYANNA MORMONT are congregated in the Great Hall.  ARYA walks into the room and hears a loud discussion.  The lords are adressing SANSA who is seated at the head table."
9656,5,4,ROBETT,"The King in the North should stay in the north.  We did not choose you to rule us, My Lady, but perhaps we should have. The men agree in unison.  YOHN ROYCE stands up and walks in front of SANSA."
9657,5,4,YOHN,"The Knights of the Vale came here for you, Lady Stark."
9658,5,4,SANSA,"You're very kind, my lords, but Jon is our king.  He is doing what he thinks is best. The men sit down and everyone in the hall begins talking to one another."
9659,5,4,TO,WINTERFELL - HALLS SANSA and ARYA are walking through the hall to SANSA's quarters having a discussion.
9660,5,4,SANSA,I warned Jon this would happen.  He can't leave the north and expect it to just sit and wait for him like Ghost.
9661,5,4,ARYA,He didn't.  He trusted you to hold it for him.
9662,5,4,SANSA,"Well, he's not making it easy.  The northern lords are proud. The girls arrive at SANSA's quarters.  ARYA is glancing around the room."
9663,5,4,ARYA,These are mother and father's chambers.
9664,5,4,SANSA,And?
9665,5,4,ARYA,Nothing.
9666,5,4,SANSA,Don't do that. SANSA turns around to face ARYA.
9667,5,4,ARYA,What?
9668,5,4,SANSA,Say what you mean.
9669,5,4,ARYA,You always liked nice things.  It made you feel better than everyone. SANSA drops the papers in her hand on a table and looks at ARYA.
9670,5,4,SANSA,Are you angry with me?
9671,5,4,ARYA,They were insulting Jon and you sat there and listened.
9672,5,4,SANSA,"I listened to their complaints, which is my responsibility as Lady of Winterfell."
9673,5,4,ARYA,Their opinions are important to you?
9674,5,4,SANSA,"Glover has 500 men.  Royce has 2,000.  Offend them and Jon loses his army."
9675,5,4,ARYA,Not if they lose their heads first.
9676,5,4,SANSA,"Winterfell didn't just fall into our hands.  We took it back, and the Mormonts and the Hornwoods and the Wildlings and the Vale, all of us working together.  Now, I'm sure cutting off heads is very satisfying, but that's not the way you get people to work together."
9677,5,4,ARYA,"And if Jon doesn't come back, you'll need their support, so you can work together to give you what you really want."
9678,5,4,SANSA,How can you even think such a horrible thing?
9679,5,4,ARYA,"You're thinking it right now.  You don't want to be, but the thought just won't go away. SANSA and ARYA stare at each in silence for a moment."
9680,5,4,SANSA,I have work to do. SANSA turns and walks away from ARYA.
9681,5,4,ARYA,My lady. ARYA exits the room.
9682,5,4,TO,KING'S LANDING - BEACH DAVOS and TYRION are standing on the beach of King's Landing.  DAVOS is securing a small row boat.  TYRION is looking up towards the city walls.
9683,5,4,TYRION,Last time I was here I killed my father with a crossbow.
9684,5,4,DAVOS,Last time I was here you killed my son with wildfire. TYRION turns to look at DAVOS.  DAVOS walks next to TYRION and stakes the boat anchor into the sand.
9685,5,4,DAVOS,There's a path to the left that hugs the cliff.  The guards hardly ever patrol it.  Too many steps. TYRION begins walking towards the path.  DAVOS follows him and quickly takes the lead.  TYRION stops and looks back towards the unattended boat.
9686,5,4,TYRION,You're not staying here?
9687,5,4,DAVOS,I've got my own business in Flea Bottom.
9688,5,4,TYRION,What if someone takes the boat?
9689,5,4,DAVOS,Then we're fucked.  Best hurry.
9690,5,4,TO,REDKEEP - DUNGEONS BRONN and JAIME are walking by the dragon skulls.  Both men have sparring swords in their hand.
9691,5,4,JAIME,We don't have time for this.  We should be preparing the city for a siege.  The Dothraki are coming.
9692,5,4,BRONN,All the more reason for you to train.  Unless you plan on fighting Dothraki 12 year olds.
9693,5,4,JAIME,I seem to recall them giving you a bit of trouble as well.
9694,5,4,BRONN,And here I am ready to train.
9695,5,4,JAIME,Why down here?
9696,5,4,BRONN,I don't think you want people to see how you look swinging that thing yet.
9697,5,4,JAIME,Today might be the day I kill you by accident.
9698,5,4,BRONN,"Oh, you won't be swinging it at me. BRONN stops walking and holds his torch out.  TYRION steps from around a pillar and looks at JAIME.  JAIME looks angrily at BRONN."
9699,5,4,BRONN,I'll leave you to it. BRONN turns and walks away leaving JAIME and TYRION alone.
9700,5,4,TYRION,I needed to see you and I knew you'd never agree to meet. JAIME remains silent and stares at TYRION.
9701,5,4,TYRION,"You made me look like a complete fool.  I thought I'd surprise you by hitting Casterly Rock, but you were three steps ahead of me.  You abandoned the family home.  Completely unsentimental.  Father would have been proud."
9702,5,4,JAIME,Don't talk about our father.
9703,5,4,TYRION,Listen to me --
9704,5,4,JAIME,I once told Bronn that if I ever saw you again I'd cut you in half. TYRION glances down at the sword in JAIME's hand.
9705,5,4,TYRION,It would take you awhile with a sparring sword. JAIME shakes his head and says nothing.
9706,5,4,TYRION,"He was going to execute me.  He knew I was innocent.  He didn't hate me because of anything I did, he hated me because of what I am.  The little monster sent to punish him.  Do you think I wanted to be born this way?  Did he think I chose --"
9707,5,4,JAIME,What do you want?
9708,5,4,TYRION,Daenerys will win this war.  You're a military man.  You must know there is no way around it.  Daenerys is not her father.  She's even willing to suspend hostilities if Cersei agrees to certain terms.
9709,5,4,JAIME,You want Cersei to bend the knee you can ask her yourself.
9710,5,4,TYRION,I -- I don't.  Daenerys doesn't.  Not right now anyway.  She has a more important request.
9711,5,4,TO,KING'S LANDING - FLEA BOTTOM Men are in the market selling their wares.  A blacksmith sharpens a sword on a grinding wheel.  DAVOS is walking through the market glancing around.  A man in a blacksmith shop pulls a sword from the fire and begins to hammer it on his anvil.  DAVOS walks into the shop.
9712,5,4,DAVOS,"I wasn't sure I'd find you. The blacksmith puts the sword down and turns around, revealing GENDRY, the bastard son of Robert Baratheon."
9713,5,4,DAVOS,I thought you might still be rowing. GENDRY chuckles and DAVOS smiles.
9714,5,4,DAVOS,"I looked in shops, taverns, brothels.  I should have known to come straight to the Street of Steel."
9715,5,4,GENDRY,Weren't you worried about the Goldcloaks?
9716,5,4,DAVOS,"I haven't been here in years.  Why should they recognize me?  Sometimes I hardly do.  Nothing fucks you harder than time. DAVOS walks to the side of the shop and inspects a rack of swords.  He pulls one, nods in approval and puts it back in its place.  He turns back to GENDRY."
9717,5,4,DAVOS,Anybody give you any trouble?
9718,5,4,GENDRY,Here I am arming Lannisters.  I never get a second look.  You were right.  Safest place for me was right under the queen's nose.
9719,5,4,DAVOS,Don't be so sure.  Safety is never a permanent state of affairs.  Bad things are coming. GENDRY nods.
9720,5,4,GENDRY,You came to get me.  You want me to come with you.
9721,5,4,DAVOS,I think you need to understand --
9722,5,4,GENDRY,I'm ready.  Let's go.
9723,5,4,DAVOS,You should know what you're heading into.
9724,5,4,GENDRY,Don't you think I've been thinking about it every swing of the hammer... how happy I am making weapons for the family that killed my father?  They tried to kill me. GENDRY is tossing his tools and apron to the side.  He picks up a satchel and swings it over his head.
9725,5,4,GENDRY,"I've been getting ready.  I never knew what for, but I've always known I'd know it when it comes."
9726,5,4,DAVOS,You might want to bring one of those swords. GENDRY smiles at DAVOS and begins walking towards the weapons.
9727,5,4,GENDRY,"I don't know much about swinging swords, but this -- GENDRY removes a giant war hammer from the wall."
9728,5,4,GENDRY,-- this I know. GENDRY and DAVOS turn and walk out of the shop.
9729,5,4,TO,KING'S LANDING - BEACH DAVOS and GENDRY are walking towards the boat DAVOS left on the beach.
9730,5,4,DAVOS,Keep your father's name to yourself.  The situation is complicated enough already. GENDRY and DAVOS arrive at the boat.  GENDRY lays his hammer on top of the boat cargo.  DAVOS is gathering the anchor and rope.  Two Goldcloaks begin walking down the beach towards the boat unnoticed by DAVOS and GENDRY.
9731,5,4,GENDRY,Who should I say I am? DAVOS turns and notices the two guards approaching the boat.  He turns and loudly addresses GENDRY.
9732,5,4,DAVOS,"I told you, Clovis, if we don't get out of here soon someone is going to -- GUARD 1:  You there. Both guards have their hands on their weapons ready to draw.  DAVOS starts walking towards the guards and spreads his cloak open.  GENDRY remains by the boat."
9733,5,4,DAVOS,"No weapons, friends.  I promise.  What can I do for you? GUARD 1:  Is that your boat?"
9734,5,4,DAVOS,It is. GENDRY looks down into the boat and sees his weapon in plain view. GUARD 2:  The docks are that way.
9735,5,4,GENDRY,That they are.  I try to stay away from them to avoid good men such as yourselves. The two guards look at each other and chuckle.  DAVOS retrieves a coin purse and opens it.
9736,5,4,DAVOS,Still five gold dragons? GUARD 1:  Are you joking? GUARD 2:  You must be even older than you look.  15.
9737,5,4,DAVOS,15? GUARD 1:  Apiece. DAVOS angrily reaches into his pouch and pays the men.
9738,5,4,DAVOS,I can't say it was a pleasure doing business with you. DAVOS turns and begins walking back to his boat. GUARD 1:  What's in the boat? DAVOS pauses and turns back to the guards.
9739,5,4,DAVOS,Not more gold. GUARD 2:  Wine? GUARD 1:  Mmm. GUARD 2:  I like wine. GUARD 1:  Or hams.
9740,5,4,DAVOS,"Come and have a look. The guards walk over to the boat.  As they approach, DAVOS walks to the boat and pulls a cover to reveal the cargo.  As he pulls back the canvas, he throws it over GENDRY's exposed weapon covering it from view.  There are several baskets of fermented meat.  The guards twist their faces in disgust."
9741,5,4,DAVOS,Fermented crab. GUARD 2:  What?
9742,5,4,DAVOS,"Fermented crab.  One bucket of this triples the brothel's earnings for the week.  A man thinks he's done, he's ready to go back to his loving family, but before he gets his britches up his lady of the hour pops a tiny spoon of that into his mouth.  Five minutes later, he's back in the race.  Here, have a taste. DAVOS scoops up a bit of fermented crab and offers it to the guards.  Both men reach out and take a pinch.  The guards sniff the crab and put it in their mouth.  They both recoil from the taste and look at each other."
9743,5,4,DAVOS,"I'd hurry to your favorite establishment or you'll put a whole in that chainmail. The guards and DAVOS laugh.  The guards turn and start walking back towards the city.  GENDRY nods at them as they go.  TYRION appears at the top of the stairs leading to the beach.  The Goldcloaks see him as he's walking down the path.  TYRION walks by the guards and they exchange glances.  The guards stop and turn back toward the boat. GUARD 2:  Oi, Dwarf! DAVOS quickly walks to cut the guards off."
9744,5,4,DAVOS,I really wouldn't try anymore until you see how the first bite hits you. GUARD 2:  That dwarf -- The guards blow past DAVOS and begin talking to TYRION. GUARD 1:  Where did you get that scar?
9745,5,4,TYRION,Fish hook.  Some men you just can't teach. GUARD 2:  We was looking for a dwarf with a scar like that awhile back. DAVOS is still standing behind the guards.  He retrieves his gold pouch again and holds it up shaking it.
9746,5,4,DAVOS,"Perhaps there's some arrangement? The two guards turn back to DAVOS. GUARD 2:  Arrangement?  You gonna arrange to pay us more than Queen Cersei? GENDRY can be seen behind the backs of the guards.  He slowly retrieves his hammer and creeps up behind GUARD 2.  He swings his hammer and connects with the side of the guard's head.  The man drops.  As GENDRY transitions onto the second guard and swings his hammer, GUARD 1 turns to look and catches a hammer blow to the face. DAVOS is looking at TYRION and motions towards GENDRY."
9747,5,4,DAVOS,This is Gendry.
9748,5,4,TYRION,He'll do. The men grab onto the boat and begin to push it into the water.
9749,5,4,TO,REDKEEP - CERSEI's QUARTERS JAIME opens the door and step into the queen's room.  CERSEI is seated near a window speaking to QYBURN.
9750,5,4,CERSEI,That won't be necessary. QYBURN bows his head and walks to leave the room.  As he passes by JAIME he addresses him.
9751,5,4,QYBURN,Ser Jaime. QYBURN closes the door as he leaves.  JAIME and CERSEI are alone.  CERSEI begins walking over to a chair in front of JAIME and sits.
9752,5,4,JAIME,Why was QYBURN here?
9753,5,4,CERSEI,He's Hand of the Queen.  Why are you here?
9754,5,4,JAIME,I met with Tyrion. CERSEI pauses for a moment making JAIME uncomfortable.
9755,5,4,CERSEI,What did our brother have to say?
9756,5,4,JAIME,Daenerys wants to meet.
9757,5,4,CERSEI,To discuss a surrender?
9758,5,4,JAIME,To discuss an armistice.
9759,5,4,CERSEI,She just won a great victory.  Why would she want a truce now?
9760,5,4,JAIME,Because an army of dead men is marching on the Seven Kingdoms.  Tyrion claims he'll have proof. CERSEI smirks and looks away from JAIME.
9761,5,4,CERSEI,Are you going to punish him?
9762,5,4,JAIME,Tyrion?
9763,5,4,CERSEI,Bronn. JAIME looks confused.
9764,5,4,CERSEI,He betrayed you.  He set up a meeting without your knowledge or consent.  Do you think anything of importance happens in this city without me knowing? JAIME shakes his head.
9765,5,4,JAIME,You let it happen.  Why?
9766,5,4,CERSEI,"I've come to believe that accomodation with the Dragon Queen could be in our immediate interest.  She has the numbers.  If we want to beat her we have to be clever.  We have to fight her like father would have.  Dead men, dragons and Dragon Queens, whatever stands in our way we will defeat it ourselves for our house.  For this. CERSEI lifts her hands from the chair and places them both on her stomach indicating she's pregnant.  JAIME looks shocked."
9767,5,4,JAIME,Who will you say is the father?
9768,5,4,CERSEI,You.
9769,5,4,JAIME,People won't like that. CERSEI stands from her chair and walks in front of JAIME.
9770,5,4,CERSEI,Do you remember what father used to say about people?
9771,5,4,JAIME,The lion doesn't concern himself with the opinions of the sheep. JAIME reaches forward and takes CERSEI and kisses her.  While they embrace CERSEI speaks to JAIME.
9772,5,4,CERSEI,Never betray me again.
9773,5,4,TO,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH GENDRY and DAVOS are walking down the beach near the Dragonglass cave.  Groups of men are carrying boxes filled with Dragonglass out of the cave.  DAVOS and GENDRY are having a discussion.
9774,5,4,DAVOS,We're leaving today.  The king's got a lot on his mind.
9775,5,4,GENDRY,I understand.
9776,5,4,DAVOS,He doesn't need to be thinking about harboring the bastard of a dead king.
9777,5,4,GENDRY,You don't have to worry.
9778,5,4,DAVOS,"You're just Clovis, a smith who's come to pay his respects before he heads off to work at the Winterfell forges."
9779,5,4,GENDRY,Understood. DAVOS and GENDRY enter the mouth of the cave.  JON is walking along the corridor.
9780,5,4,DAVOS,"Begging your pardon, Your Grace. JON stops and turns around to face DAVOS."
9781,5,4,JON,You survived King's Landing.
9782,5,4,DAVOS,Yet again.
9783,5,4,JON,"Your Grace, this is -- GENDRY steps forward in front of DAVOS."
9784,5,4,GENDRY,"It's Gendry, Your Grace.  I'm Robert Baratheon's son.  Bastard son. JON looks to DAVOS."
9785,5,4,DAVOS,He was meant to keep that to himself.
9786,5,4,GENDRY,Our fathers trusted each other.  Why shouldn't we?
9787,5,4,JON,I saw your father once at Winterfell.
9788,5,4,GENDRY,I met yours in my shop.
9789,5,4,JON,You're a lot leaner.
9790,5,4,GENDRY,You're a lot shorter. JON stops smiling and pauses a moment.  Then he chuckles.
9791,5,4,JON,I grew up on stories about them.
9792,5,4,GENDRY,"All I ever knew was they fought together and won.  Ser Davos told me where you're going, Your Grace, and why.  Let me come with you."
9793,5,4,DAVOS,Don't be a fool.  You're not a soldier.
9794,5,4,GENDRY,"No, but I'm a fighter.  And he won't be needing a smith with a sword like that."
9795,5,4,JON,Do you know how to use one? GENDRY shakes his head.
9796,5,4,JON,"Well, that's a problem."
9797,5,4,GENDRY,I prefer a hammer. GENDRY looks to DAVOS.
9798,5,4,DAVOS,He can handle himself. JON nods.
9799,5,4,JON,We could use the help.
9800,5,4,DAVOS,"As my father used to say, it's better to be a coward for a minute than dead for the rest of your life. GENDRY(to DAVOS):  I owe you my life.  Twice over.  But if what you said is true about what's out there, I can't wait out this war."
9801,5,4,DAVOS,Yeah.  Nobody mind me.  All I've ever done is live to a ripe old age.
9802,5,4,TO,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH Two landing boats are sitting on the beach surrounded by two groups of men.  A large sailboat is anchored in the bay.  JORAH places his sword and a case of Dragonglass into the boat.  TYRION walks down the beach and stands next to JORAH.
9803,5,4,TYRION,"You may not believe it, but I've missed you Mormont.  Nobody glowers quite like you.  Not even Grey Worm. TYRION retrieves a gold coin from his pocket and turns it in his hands."
9804,5,4,TYRION,This is the coin the slaver gave me when I suggested he free us and pay us.  Remember?
9805,5,4,JORAH,It was supposed to last us the rest of our lives. TYRION smiles and hands the coin to JORAH.
9806,5,4,TYRION,Take it with you.  You'll bring it back.  Our queen needs you. JORAH nods to TYRION.  DAENERYS appears and walks up to JORAH.
9807,5,4,DAENERYS,We should be better at saying farewell by now.
9808,5,4,JORAH,"Your Grace, I -- DAENERYS reaches forward and takes JORAH by his hands.  JON SNOW, DAVOS and GENDRY exit the cave and walk towards the boats.  JORAH bends and kisses DAENERY's hand.  He turns and continues readying the boat.  JON stands in front of DAENERYS."
9809,5,4,JON,If I don't return at least you won't have to deal with the King in the North anymore. DAENERYS smiles.
9810,5,4,DAENERYS,But I've grown used to him.
9811,5,4,JON,"I wish you good fortune in the wars to come, Your Grace. DAENERYS nods to JON.  JON turns and walks to the head of the boat.  The men take hold of it."
9812,5,4,JON,Heave! The men push the boat into the sea.  DAENERYS and TYRION remain on the beach watching them go.
9813,5,4,TO,CITADEL - SAMWELL's QUARTERS SAM is seated at a table surround by papers and candles.  He is writing notes into a book.  Gilly is seated across from him reading aloud from a tome.  SAM JR. is playing on the bed.
9814,5,4,GILLY,Do you know how many steps there are in the Citadel?
9815,5,4,SAM,No.
9816,5,4,GILLY,"15,782. SAM looks up from his work annoyed.  He remains silent and continues working."
9817,5,4,GILLY,Guess how many windows are in the Great Sept of Baelor. SAMWELL looks away and pauses.
9818,5,4,SAMWELL,None anymore.
9819,5,4,GILLY,"That's true.  This High Septon Meynard, he recorded everything.  He even recorded his own bowel movements.  What does ""annulment"" mean?"
9820,5,4,SAMWELL,It's when a man sets asside his lawful wife.
9821,5,4,GILLY,Meynard says here that he issued an anullment for Prince Rhaegar and remarried him to someone else at the same time in a secret ceremony in Dorne.  Is that a common thing -- SAMWELL isn't paying much attention to GILLY.  He loudly interrupts her.
9822,5,4,SAMWELL,"These maesters, they set me to the task of preserving that man's window counting and anullments and bowel movements for all eternity while the secret to defeating the Night King's probably sitting on some dusty shelf somewhere completely ignored.  But that's all right, isn't it.  We could all become slavering, murderous imbecils enthralled to evil incarnate as long as we can have access to the full records of High Septon Meynard's 15,782 shits."
9823,5,4,GILLY,Steps.  That number was steps. SAMWELL is dismayed.  He sets his quill down and grabs the book he was writing in and hands it to SAM Jr.  He retrieves his cloak and walks out the door.
9824,5,4,TO,"CITADEL - LIBRARY SAM is walking through a dark library.  He heads to the restricted section and unlocks the barred gate.  He begins removing books and scrolls from shelfs and stuff them in his satchel.  After retrieving what he needs, SAM quickly walks to the exit of the library.  He pauses before he leaves and turns around.  He glances back at the library.  It is many stories tall lined with countless  shelves of books.  SAMWELL looks at the library one last time, turns and walks out of the door."
9825,5,4,TO,EXT. CITADEL SAMWELL is loading a wagon with his things.  He walks around to the driver seat.  GILLY and SAM JR. are already in the wagon dressed for the road.  SAM climbs aboard and takes the reins in his hand.
9826,5,4,GILLY,Are you sure you want to do this?  You always wanted to be a maester.
9827,5,4,SAMWELL,I'm tired of reading about the achievements of better men. The horse neighs and begins pulling the carriage away from the city.  The Citadel can be seen with a torch burning bright on top of the tallest tower.
9828,5,4,TO,WINTERFELL - KENNELS ARYA is in the kennels observing PETER BAELISH and a Winterfell servant having a conversation.  The servent is whispering in BAELISH's ear.  ARYA can't hear the conversation.  ARYA sees BAELISH hand the servant a raven scroll.  The servant turns to leave.  BAELISH senses someone is watching him and he looks to where ARYA stood but she has already vanished.  BAELISH turns and leaves the kennels.
9829,5,4,TO,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD ARYA is on the upper level looking down at BAELISH.  He is having a conversation with ROBETT GLOVER and YOHN ROYCE.  She can't hear what's being said.  BAELISH finishes his conversation and walks away from the men.  ARYA disappears behind the corner and continues following BAELISH.
9830,5,4,TO,"WINTERFELL - HALLS ARYA is walking down the hallway.  She pauses, peers around a corner and looks towards the door of BAELISH's quarters.  BAELISH appears and unlocks his door.  Before he walks in MAESTER WOLKAN approaches him.  She continues watching the men."
9831,5,4,WOLKAN,"I found it, my Lord. WOLKAN hands BAELISH a raven scroll."
9832,5,4,WOLKAN,It took some searching.  Maester Llewyn's archives are thorough. BAELISH reads the note then looks at WOLKAN.
9833,5,4,BAELISH,Are you sure this is the only copy at Winterfell?
9834,5,4,WOLKAN,"Yes, my Lord."
9835,5,4,BAELISH,"Lady Stark thanks you for your service. WOLKAN turns and walks away.  BAELISH enters his room and shuts the door.  ARYA continues watching.  A moment later BAELISH opens the door and exits the room, locking the door as he leaves.  After he is gone ARYA walks to the door and produces a lockpick from her sleeve.  She enters the room and begins searching for the raven scroll.  She opens a cabinet but finds nothing of value.  She checks another cabinet, then looks in the fireplace and above the mantle finding nothing.  She lifts up the mattress and finds a small hole cut into the bedding.  She reaches in and retrives the raven scroll.  She unrolls it and reads the contents. ""Robb, I write to you with a heavy heart. Our good king Robert is dead, killed from wounds he took in a boar hunt. Father has been charged with treason. He conspired with Robert's brothers against my beloved Joffrey and tried to steal his throne. The Lannisters are treating me very well and provide me with every comfort. I beg you: come to King's Landing, swear fealty to King Joffrey and prevent any strife between the great houses of Lannister and Stark. Your faithfull sister, Sansa."" Arya rerolls the note and exits the room.  She locks the door behind her and leaves the hallway.  After a moment BAELISH emerges from a dark corner, watching ARYA with a smirk on his face."
9836,5,4,TO,EASTWATCH - BEACH JON and the raiding party land on the Beach of Eastwatch.  JON looks up at the castle.  The men collect their equipment and make for the castle.
9837,5,4,TO,"INT. EASTWATCH - GREAT HALL TORMUND, JON, DAVOS, GENDRY, and JORAH sit at a table having a conversation."
9838,5,4,TORMUND,Isn't it your job to talk him out of stupid fucking ideas like this?
9839,5,4,DAVOS,I've been failing at that job of late.
9840,5,4,TORMUND,How many queens are there now?
9841,5,4,JON,Two.
9842,5,4,TORMUND,And you need to convince the one with the dragons or the one who fucks her brother?
9843,5,4,JON,Both.
9844,5,4,TORMUND,How many men did you bring? JON looks around the table.
9845,5,4,JON,Not enough.
9846,5,4,TORMUND,The big woman? JON smiles and shakes his head.  TORMUND is disappointed.
9847,5,4,JORAH,We were hoping some of your men could help.
9848,5,4,DAVOS,I'll be staying behind.  I'm a liability out there as you well know. TORMUND nods his head.
9849,5,4,TORMUND,You are. TORMUND turns to look at JON.
9850,5,4,TORMUND,You really want to go out there again? JON nods.
9851,5,4,TORMUND,You're not the only ones.
9852,5,4,TO,EASTWATCH - CELLS The raiding party walk down to the Eastwatch cells.  TORMUND is leading them.
9853,5,4,TORMUND,"My scouts found them a mile south of the Wall.  Said they were on their way here. The men look into the cells.  It is occupied by SANDOR CLEGANE, THOROS of MYR, and BERIC DONDARRION."
9854,5,4,JON,You're The Hound.  I saw you once at Winterfell. SANDOR pulls a blanket tight around himself and sits up from the table he was laying on.
9855,5,4,TORMUND,They want to go beyond the Wall too.
9856,5,4,BERIC,"We don't want to go beyond the Wall, we have to.  Our lord told us the great war is coming."
9857,5,4,GENDRY,Don't trust them.  Don't trust any of them. The men turn to look at GENDRY.  GENDRY walks up and presses his face to the bars of the cell.
9858,5,4,GENDRY,They're the Brotherhood.  And the last thing their Lord told them to do was sell me to a Red Witch to be murdered.
9859,5,4,JORAH,Thoros? THOROS sits up from a dark corner.
9860,5,4,JORAH,I hardly recognized you.
9861,5,4,THOROS,Ser Jorah Mormont -- TORMUND turns and angrily looks at JORAH.
9862,5,4,THOROS,They won't give me anything to drink down here.  I haven't been feeling like myself.
9863,5,4,TORMUND,You're a fucking Mormont?  Like the last Lord Commander?
9864,5,4,JORAH,He was my father.
9865,5,4,TORMUND,He hunted us like animals.
9866,5,4,JORAH,"You returned the favor, as I recall."
9867,5,4,BERIC,Here we all are at the edge of the world at the same moment heading in the same direction for the same reason.
9868,5,4,DAVOS,Our reasons aren't your reasons.
9869,5,4,BERIC,It doesn't matter what we think our reasons are. BERIC stands up and walks towards the bars of the cell.
9870,5,4,BERIC,There's a greater purpose at work and we serve it together whether we know it or not.  We may take the steps but the Lord of Light --
9871,5,4,SANDOR,"For fuck's sake, will you shut your hole.  Are we coming with you or not?"
9872,5,4,JORAH,Don't you want to know what we're doing?
9873,5,4,THOROS,Is it worse than sitting in a freezing cell waiting to die?
9874,5,4,JON,He's right.  We're all on the same side.
9875,5,4,GENDRY,How can we be?
9876,5,4,JON,We're all breathing. TORMUND hands the cell keys to JON.  JON opens the door and let the men out.
9877,5,5,DEFAULT,"Beyond the Wall (Script) Lyrics Script in progress Beyond The Wall INT. DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE The camera floats over the painted table showing detailed carvings of rivers, holdfasts, and cities.  A fire burns in the hearth."
9878,5,5,TO,"BEYOND THE WALL A raiding party consisting of JON SNOW, TORMUND, GENDRY BRATHEON, JORAH MORMONT, SANDOR CLEGANE, BERIC DONDARRIAN, THOROS of MYR and several Wildlings are ranging beyond the wall of Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.  The men trek through a frozen valley filled with jagged rocks.  The Wildlings are pulling a sled loaded with gear and provisions.  The camera shifts and the men are climbing a steep mountain covered in snow. JON(to Gendry):  Are you all right? GENDRY faces JON and grunts."
9879,5,5,JON,Ever been north before?
9880,5,5,GENDRY,Never seen snow before.
9881,5,5,TORMUND,"Beautiful, eh?  I can breath again.  Down south the air smells like pig shit."
9882,5,5,JON,You've never been down south.
9883,5,5,TORMUND,I've been to Winterfell.
9884,5,5,JON,That's the north. The group of men continue north.  A Wildling scout is ahead of the group surveying the area. GENDRY(to TORMUND):  How do you live up here?  How do you keep your balls from freezing off?
9885,5,5,TORMUND,"You have to keep moving.  That's the secret.  Walking is good, fighting is better, fucking is best."
9886,5,5,JON,There's not another woman within 100 miles of here. TORMUND turns to look at JON and GENDRY.
9887,5,5,TORMUND,We have to make due with what we've got. JON glances at GENDRY.  GENDRY backs away from JON and TORMUND.
9888,5,5,TORMUND,This one is maybe not so smart.
9889,5,5,JON,Davos says he is a strong fighter.
9890,5,5,TORMUND,Good.  That's more important than being smart. TORMUND looks at JON as they continue to walk.
9891,5,5,TORMUND,"Smart people don't come up here looking for the dead.  So, you met this Dragon Queen, huh?  And?"
9892,5,5,JON,She'll only fight beside us if I bend the knee.
9893,5,5,TORMUND,"You spent too much time with the free folk and now you don't like kneeling.  Mance Rayder was a great man, a proud man.  The king beyond the wall never bent the knee.  How many of his people died for his pride? The camera pans out to a frozen vista.  The men are walking across broken slabs of ice and tundra.  There are mountains and a lake of ice in the distance.  The view shifts to GENDRY walking along with THOROS, BERIC and SANDOR.  THOROS is carrying his wine flask."
9894,5,5,THOROS,"Are you still mad at us, boy?"
9895,5,5,GENDRY,You sold me to a witch.
9896,5,5,THOROS,"Priestess.  I'll admit, it is a subtle distinction."
9897,5,5,BERIC,We're fighting a great war.  Wars cost money.
9898,5,5,GENDRY,"I wanted to be one of you.  I wanted to join the Brotherhood but you sold me off like a slave.  Do you know what she did to me?  She strapped me down on a bed, she stripped me naked --"
9899,5,5,SANDOR,Sounds all right so far.
9900,5,5,GENDRY,-- and put leeches on me.
9901,5,5,SANDOR,Was she naked too?
9902,5,5,THOROS,She needed your blood.
9903,5,5,GENDRY,Yes. Thank you.  I know that. SANDOR steps in front of GENDRY to halt him.
9904,5,5,SANDOR,It could have been worse.
9905,5,5,GENDRY,She wanted to kill me.  They would have killed me if it wasn't for Davos --
9906,5,5,SANDOR,"But they didn't, did they?  So what you whinging about?"
9907,5,5,GENDRY,I'm not whinging.
9908,5,5,SANDOR,Your lips are moving and you're complaining about something.  That's whinging. SANDOR motions to BERIC.
9909,5,5,SANDOR,This one's been killed six times.  You don't hear him bitching about it. SANDOR walks away to join the group.  BERIC and THOROS smile to each other.  THOROS holds his wine flask out to GENDRY who takes a large gulp and hands it back to THOROS.
9910,5,5,THOROS,Good lad. The camera shifts to the head of the line.  JON is walking with JORAH.
9911,5,5,JON,The first time I went north of the wall was with your father.
9912,5,5,JORAH,He was a good man.  He deserved a better son.  Were you with him at the end?
9913,5,5,JON,I was a prisoner of the Wildlings.  But we avenged him.  I want you to know that every mutineer found justice.
9914,5,5,JORAH,"I can't think of a worse way for him to go.  The Night's Watch was his life.  He would have died to protect every one of those men, and they butchered him."
9915,5,5,JON,I hate that he died that way.  My father was the most honorable man I ever met.  He was good all the way through.  And he died on the executioner's block.
9916,5,5,JORAH,Your father wanted to execute me.
9917,5,5,JON,I heard.
9918,5,5,JORAH,He was in the right of course.  It didn't make me hate him any less. JORAH and JON glance at each other.
9919,5,5,JON,I'm glad he didn't capture you.
9920,5,5,JORAH,Me too. JON stops walking and loosens the belt holding his sword.
9921,5,5,JON,"Your father gave me this sword.  He changed the pommel from a bear to a wolf, but it's still Long Claw. JON hands the sword to JORAH.  JORAH slowly takes the sword and looks it over in his hands."
9922,5,5,JON,Lord Commander Mormont thought you'd never come back to Westeros. JORAH stops examining the sword and looks up to JON.
9923,5,5,JON,"But you are back and it's been in your family for centuries.  It's not right for me to have it. JORAH pauses, then nods at JON."
9924,5,5,JORAH,He gave it to you.
9925,5,5,JON,"I'm not his son. JORAH pulls the sword halfway out of the sheath and inspects the blade, turning it in his hands."
9926,5,5,JORAH,I brought shame to my house.  I broke my father's heart. JORAH resheaths the blade and hands it back to JON.
9927,5,5,JORAH,I forfeited the right to claim this sword.  It's yours.  May it serve you well and your children after you.
9928,5,5,TO,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD Snow is falling into the courtyard.  The ground is covered with several inches of snow.  Several braziers are burning and a servant carries a bucket of steaming water across the grounds.  ARYA is standing on the upper level looking into the courtyard.  SANSA approaches her from behind.
9929,5,5,ARYA,Father used to watch us from up here.  He wouldn't say much.  You probably don't remember.  You were inside knitting all the time.
9930,5,5,SANSA,I remember.
9931,5,5,ARYA,"One time the boys were shooting arrows with Ser Rodrick.  I came out here after and Bran had left his bow behind just lying on the ground.  Ser Rodrick would have cuffed him if he saw.  There was one arrow in the target.  There was no one around, just like now.  No one to stop me.  So I started shooting.  And every shot I had to go out there and get my one arrow and walk back and shoot it again.  I wasn't very good.  Finally I hit the bullseye.  It could have been the 20th shot or the 50th.  I don't remember.  But I hit the bullseye and I heard this. ARYA starts a slow clap."
9932,5,5,ARYA,I looked up and he's standing right here smiling down at me.  I knew what I was doing was against the rules.  But he was smiling so I knew it wasn't wrong.  The rules were wrong.  I was doing what I was meant to be doing and he knew it.  Now he's dead.  Killed by the Lannisters with your help. SANSA turns to look at ARYA.
9933,5,5,SANSA,What? ARYA retrieves a raven scroll from her pocket and unrolls it.
9934,5,5,ARYA,"That's your pretty handwriting.  Septa Mordane used to crack my knuckles because I couldn't write as well as you.  ""Robb, I write to you today with heavy heart.  Our good King Robert is dead.  Killed from wounds he took in a boar hunt --"
9935,5,5,SANSA,You don't have to read it.  I remember.
9936,5,5,ARYA,"""Father has been charged with treason.  He conspired with Robert's brothers against my beloved Joffrey and tried to steal his throne.  The Lannisters are treating me well and providing me with every comfort.  I beg you, come to King's Landing, swear fealty to King Joffrey and prevent any strife between the great houses of Lannister and Stark.  Your faithful sister, Sansa."""
9937,5,5,SANSA,They forced me to do it.
9938,5,5,ARYA,Did they.  With a knife at your throat?  Did they put you on a rack and stretch you until your bones started to pop?
9939,5,5,SANSA,You don't know what it was like.  I was a child.
9940,5,5,ARYA,So was I.  I would have let them kill me before I betrayed my family.
9941,5,5,SANSA,They told me it was the only way to save father.
9942,5,5,ARYA,And you were stupid enough to believe them.  I remember you standing on that platform with Joffrey and Cersei when they dragged father too the block.  I remember the pretty dress you were wearing.  I remember the fancy way you did your hair.
9943,5,5,SANSA,You were there?
9944,5,5,ARYA,I was there standing in the crowd near Baelor's statue.
9945,5,5,SANSA,And what did you do?  Did you come running to the rescue?  Did you fight off the Lannisters and save father?
9946,5,5,ARYA,I wanted to.
9947,5,5,SANSA,But you didn't.  Just like me.
9948,5,5,ARYA,I didn't betray him.  I didn't betray Robb.  I didn't betray our entire family for my beloved Joffrey.
9949,5,5,SANSA,"You should be on your knees thanking me.  We're standing in Winterfell again because of me.  You didn't win it back.  Jon didn't win it back.  He lost the Battle of the Bastards.  The Knight's of the Vale won the battle and they rode north for me while you were off where, traveling the world?"
9950,5,5,ARYA,I was training.
9951,5,5,SANSA,"Training.  Well, while you were training I suffered things you can never imagine."
9952,5,5,ARYA,"Oh, I don't know about that.  I can imagine quite a lot."
9953,5,5,SANSA,You never would have survived what I survived.
9954,5,5,ARYA,I guess we'll never know.
9955,5,5,SANSA,What are you doing to do with that letter.
9956,5,5,ARYA,I don't know yet.
9957,5,5,SANSA,Who did you show it to?  Where did you find it?
9958,5,5,ARYA,"You're scared, aren't you?  What are you scared of?  You didn't commit any crimes.  No one's going to hang you."
9959,5,5,SANSA,Arya --
9960,5,5,ARYA,Are you scared I'll show it to Jon and he'll be angry?  No.  That's not Jon.  He'll understand.  You were just a scared little girl all alone with the wicked Lannisters.
9961,5,5,SANSA,"Do you know how happy Cersei would be if she saw us fighting?  This is exactly what she wants.  This is what she's always wanted, to tear us apart --"
9962,5,5,ARYA,"The northern lords will read it.  They wouldn't think much of Lady Sansa if they knew how she did Cersei's bidding.  What would little Lyanna Mormont say?  She's younger than you were when you wrote this.  Are you going to say, ""But I was just a child""?"
9963,5,5,SANSA,You're angry.  Sometimes anger makes people do unfortunate things.
9964,5,5,ARYA,Sometimes fear makes them do unfortunate things.  I'll go with anger. ARYA turns and walks away.
9965,5,5,TO,- BEYOND THE WALL The raiding party are marching single file acorss the frozen tundra.  SANDOR stops to tie a fur cover over his boot that came loose.  TORMUND approaches him.
9966,5,5,TORMUND,You're one big ugly dog.
9967,5,5,SANDOR,Fuck off.
9968,5,5,TORMUND,They told me you were mean.  Were you born mean or you just hate Wildlings?
9969,5,5,SANDOR,I don't give two shits about Wildlings. SANDOR looks up at TORMUND.
9970,5,5,SANDOR,Gingers I hate.
9971,5,5,TORMUND,Gingers are beautiful.  We are kissed by fire.  Just like you. TORMUND points and motions to SANDOR's burned face.  SANDOR slaps his hand away.
9972,5,5,SANDOR,Don't point your fucking finger at me. SANDOR walks away to rejoin the group.  TORMUND begins smiling and walks after him.
9973,5,5,TORMUND,Did you trip into the fire when you were a baby?
9974,5,5,SANDOR,I didn't trip.  I was pushed.
9975,5,5,TORMUND,Ever since you've been mean.
9976,5,5,SANDOR,Will you fuck off?
9977,5,5,TORMUND,I don't think you're truly mean.  You have sad eyes. SANDOR stops and turns to TORMUND.
9978,5,5,SANDOR,Do you want to suck my dick?  Is that it?
9979,5,5,TORMUND,Dick?
9980,5,5,SANDOR,Cock.
9981,5,5,TORMUND,Ah.  Dick.  I like it.
9982,5,5,SANDOR,"I bet you do. SANDOR turns and begins walking, TORMUND follows."
9983,5,5,TORMUND,Nope.  It's pussy for me.  I have a beauty waiting for me back at Winterfell.  If I ever get back there.  Yellow hair.  Blue eyes.  Tallest woman you've ever seen.  Almost as tall as you. SANDOR stops and glances at TORMUND.
9984,5,5,SANDOR,Brienne of Tarth.
9985,5,5,TORMUND,You know her?
9986,5,5,SANDOR,You're with Brienne of fucking Tarth?
9987,5,5,TORMUND,"Well, not with her yet, but I see the way she looks at me."
9988,5,5,SANDOR,How does she look at you?  Like she wants to carve you up and eat your liver? TORMUND nods.
9989,5,5,TORMUND,You do know her.
9990,5,5,SANDOR,We've met. SANDOR and TORMUND begin walking.
9991,5,5,TORMUND,I want to make babies with her.  Think of the great big monsters.  They'd conquer the world.
9992,5,5,SANDOR,How did a mad fucker like you live this long?
9993,5,5,TORMUND,I'm good at killing people. The camera shifts to the middle of the line.  JON and BERIC are walking together.
9994,5,5,BERIC,You don't much look like him.
9995,5,5,JON,Who's that?
9996,5,5,BERIC,Your father.  I suppose you favor your mother.
9997,5,5,JON,You knew him?
9998,5,5,BERIC,Of course I did.  When he was Hand he sent me off hunting for The Mountain.  Your Wildling friend told me the red woman brought you back.  Thoros has brought me back six times.  We both serve the same lord.
9999,5,5,JON,I serve the north.
10000,5,5,BERIC,The north didn't raise you from the dead.
10001,5,5,JON,The lord of light never spoke to me.  I don't know anything about him.  I don't know what he wants from me.
10002,5,5,BERIC,He wants you alive.
10003,5,5,JON,Why?
10004,5,5,BERIC,I don't know.
10005,5,5,JON,"That's all anyone can tell me, I don't know.  So what's the point in serving a god that none of us knows what he wants."
10006,5,5,BERIC,I think about that all the time.  I don't think it's our purpose to understand except one thing.  We're soldiers.  We have to know what we're fighting for.  I'm not fighting so some man or woman I barely know can sit on a throne made of swords.
10007,5,5,JON,So what are you fighting for?
10008,5,5,BERIC,Life.  Death is the enemy.  The first enemy and the last.
10009,5,5,JON,But we all die.
10010,5,5,BERIC,The enemy always wins.  And we still need to fight him.  That's all I know.  You and I wont find much joy while we're here.  But we can keep others alive.  We can defend those who can't defend themselves.
10011,5,5,JON,"""I am the shield that guards the realms of men."""
10012,5,5,BERIC,Maybe we don't need to understand any more than that.  Maybe that's enough.
10013,5,5,JON,Aye.  Maybe that's enough. SANDOR stops and looks into the distance.  There is a steep mountain ascending into the clouds in the distance.
10014,5,5,SANDOR,That's what I saw in the fire. SANDOR points towards the mountain.
10015,5,5,SANDOR,A mountain like an arrowhead.
10016,5,5,THOROS,Are you sure? SANDOR turns to THOROS and nods his head.
10017,5,5,SANDOR,We're getting close. The men start walking towards the base of the mountain.
10018,5,5,TO,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE TYRION is sitting in a chair staring into the fire.  DAENERYS stands across the room next to the painted table.
10019,5,5,DAENERYS,Do you know what I like about you? TYRION turns to look at DAENERYS.
10020,5,5,TYRION,I honestly don't.
10021,5,5,DAENERYS,You're not a hero.
10022,5,5,TYRION,Oh.  I've been heroic on occasion. DAENERYS walks over to the fire and sits in the chair opposite from TYRION.
10023,5,5,TYRION,I once charged through the mud gate of King's Landing.
10024,5,5,DAENERYS,"I don't want you to be a hero.  Heroes do stupid things and they die.  Drogo, Jorah, Dario, even this Jon Snow, they all try to outdo each other of who can do the stupidist, bravest thing."
10025,5,5,TYRION,"It's interesting these heroes you name.  Drogo, Jorah, Dario, even this Jon Snow, they all fell in love with you."
10026,5,5,DAENERYS,Jon Snow's not in love with me.

That's more people than the entire North crammed into that. Why would anyone want to live that way? There's more work in the city. And the brothels are far superior."
10032,5,6,CERSEI,"Why isn't she with them? QYBURN: I'm afraid I don't know, Your Grace. No one has seen her. And the rest of them? They're on their way to the Dragonpit now. Including our brother? Yes, Your Grace. If anything goes wrong, kill the silver-haired bitch first, then our brother, then the bastard who calls himself king. The rest of them you can kill in any order you see fit. Come, Ser Gregor. It's time for us to meet our guests."
10033,5,6,MISSANDEI,"Why did they build it? Dragons don't understand the difference between what is theirs and what isn't. Land, livestock, children Letting them roam free around a city was a problem. I imagine it was a sad joke at the end. An entire arena for a few sickly creatures smaller than dogs. But in the beginning, when it was home to Balerion the Dread, it must have been the most dangerous place in the world. Maybe it still is. Welcome, my lords. Your friends arrived before you did. I've been sent to escort you all to the meeting. A pleasant surprise in an unpleasant situation. I never thought I'd see you again, my lord. Supporting the enemy, no less. - Hard to blame you. - Cersei will anyway. I'm glad you're alive."
10034,5,6,BRONN,Come on! You can suck his magic cock later. What's in there? Fuck off. I thought you were dead. Not yet. You came pretty close. I was only trying to protect her. You and me both. She's alive. Arya. - Where? - Winterfell. Who's protecting her if you're here? The only one that needs protecting is the one that gets in her way. It won't be me.
10035,5,6,TYRION,"Here we are the heroes of Blackwater Bay. Strange place for a reunion. It is, my lord. I don't think I'm anyone's lord anymore, Podrick. Save the titles for Ser Bronn of the Blackwater. I'm sure your new queen will be happy to restore yours if she ends up on the throne. You've been thinking about our new queen? Perhaps you've been reconsidering your allegiances. Remember my offer whatever they're paying you, I'll pay double. And that would be double what now, exactly? Don't you worry about me. I'm doing all right. - Looking after myself."
10036,5,6,TYRION,"Are you? Helping me to arrange this meeting wasn't exactly looking after yourself, was it? You put yourself at risk. I put yourself at risk. Important difference. It's your head Queen Cersei's offered a bag of gold for, it's not mine. Now, thanks to me, she's got two traitors' heads coming right through her door. She can lop them both off as soon as she gets tired of the clever words that pour out their pieholes. All thanks to Ser Bronn of the fucking Blackwater. If that's not looking after myself, I don't know what is. It's good to see you again. Yeah, you, too. Anyone touches it, I'll kill you first. Come on, Pod. Let's you and me go have a drink while the fancy folks talk, eh? I left this shit city because I didn't want to die in it. Am I going to die in this shit city? You might. And this is all your idea. Seems every bad idea has some Lannister cunt behind it. And some Clegane cunt to help them see it through. (FOOTSTEPS APPROACH) Remember me? Yeah, you do. You're even fucking uglier than I am now. What did they do to you? Doesn't matter. That's not how it ends for you, brother. You know who's coming for you. You've always known. Where is she? She'll be here soon. Didn't travel with you? No. (DRAGONS SCREECHING) - (SCREECHING) - (WINGS FLAPPING) (ROARING) (ROARING) We've been here for some time. My apologies."
10037,5,6,EURON,"Theon! I have your sister. If you don't submit to me here, now I'll kill her. I think we ought to begin with larger concerns. Then why are you talking? You're the smallest concern here. Do you remember when we discussed dwarf jokes? His wasn't even good. He explained it at the end. Never explain. It always ruins it. We don't even let your kind live in the Iron Islands, you know? We kill you at birth. An act of mercy for the parents. Perhaps you ought to sit down. Why? Sit down or leave. (LAUGHING) We are a group of people who do not like one another, as this recent demonstration has shown. We have suffered at each other's hands. We have lost people we love at each other's hands. If all we wanted was more of the same, there would be no need for this gathering. We are entirely capable of waging war against each other without meeting face-to-face. So instead, we should settle our differences and live together in harmony for the rest of our days? We all know that will never happen. Then why are we here? This isn't about living in harmony. It's just about living. The same thing is coming for all of us. A general you can't negotiate with. An army that doesn't leave corpses behind on the battlefield. Lord Tyrion tells me a million people live in this city. They're about to become a million more soldiers in the Army of the Dead. I imagine for most of them it would be an improvement. This is serious. I wouldn't be here if it weren't. I don't think it's serious at all. I think it's another bad joke. If my brother Jaime has informed me correctly, you're asking me for a truce. Yes. That's all. That's all? Pull back my armies and stand down while you go on your monster hunt. Or while you solidify and expand your position. Hard for me to know which it is with my armies pulled back until you return and march on my capital with four times the men. Your capital will be safe until the northern threat is dealt with. You have my word. The word of a would-be usurper. There is no conversation that will erase the last 50 years. We have something to show you. (CHAINS RATTLING) (BOX THUDS) (SCREECHING) (GRUNTS) (SCREECHING) We can destroy them by burning them. (SCREECHING) And we can destroy them with dragonglass. If we don't win this fight, then that is the fate of every person in the world. (GRUNTS) There is only one war that matters the Great War. And it is here."
10038,5,6,DAENERYS,"I didn't believe it until I saw them. I saw them all. How many? A hundred thousand, at least. Can they swim? No. Good. I'm taking the Iron Fleet back to the Iron Islands. What are you talking about? I've been around the world. I've seen everything, things you couldn't imagine, and this this is the only thing I've ever seen that terrifies me. I'm going back to my island. You should go back to yours. When winter's over, we'll be the only ones left alive."
10039,5,6,CERSEI,"He's right to be afraid. And a coward to run. If those things come for us, there will be no kingdoms to rule. Everything we suffered will have been for nothing. Everything we lost will have been for nothing. The crown accepts your truce. Until the dead are defeated, they are the true enemy. (SIGHS) In return, the King in the North will extend this truce. He will remain in the North where he belongs. He will not take up arms against the Lannisters. He will not choose sides."
10040,5,6,DAENERYS,"Just the King in the North? - Not me? - (CERSEI CHUCKLES) I would never ask it of you. You would never agree to it. And if you did, I would trust you even less than I do now. I ask it only of Ned Stark's son. I know Ned Stark's son will be true to his word. I am true to my word. Or I try to be. That is why I cannot give you what you ask. I cannot serve two queens. And I have already pledged myself to Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen. Then there is nothing left to discuss. The dead will come north first. Enjoy dealing with them. We will deal with whatever is left of you."
10041,5,6,BRIENNE,"Ser Jaime. It's been good to see you. I imagine the next time will be across a battlefield. We both saw what just happened. We both saw that thing. Yes, and I'm not looking forward to seeing more of them. But I'm loyal to the queen, and you're loyal to Sansa and her dolt brother. Oh, fuck loyalty! Fuck loyalty? This goes beyond houses and honor and oaths. Talk to the queen."
10042,5,6,DAVOS,"I wish you hadn't done that. I'm grateful for your loyalty, but my dragon died so that we could be here. If it's all for nothing, then he died for nothing. I know! I'm pleased you bent the knee to our queen. I would have advised it, had you asked. But have you ever considered learning how to lie every now and then? Just a bit? I'm not going to swear an oath I can't uphold. Talk about my father if you want, tell me that's the attitude that got him killed. But when enough people make false promises, words stop meaning anything. Then there are no more answers, only better and better lies. And lies won't help us in this fight."
10043,5,6,TYRION,"That is indeed a problem. The more immediate problem is that we're fucked. Any ideas as to how we might change that state of affairs? Only one. Everyone stays here, and I go and talk to my sister. I didn't come all this way to have my Hand murdered. I don't want Cersei to murder me either. I could have stayed in my cell and saved a great deal of trouble."
10044,5,6,JON,"I did this. - I should go. - She'll definitely murder you. I go see my sister alone. Or we all go home and we're right back where we started. - You spoke with her? - At her until she kicked me out. She thinks I was an idiot to trust you. A lot of people seem to think that, actually. I'm about to step into a room with the most murderous woman in the world who's already tried to kill me twice, that I know of. Who's an idiot? I suppose we should say goodbye, one idiot to another. I shouldn't be surprised, I suppose. She's your kind of woman a foreign whore who doesn't know her place. A foreign whore you can't abduct, beat, or intimidate. That must be difficult for you. So you bring her here with her pet Northerner, - whom you've convinced to bow down before her. - I didn't know about that. And now you've got them both working towards the same goal, the goal you've worked towards your entire life - Cersei, I didn't know. - the destruction of this family. I am the one preventing that from happening. Daenerys didn't want to debate and negotiate. She didn't want to bring you words. She wanted to bring you fire and blood until I advised her otherwise. I don't want to destroy our family. I never have. You killed our father. After he sentenced me to death for a crime I didn't commit, yes, I killed him. Hate me for it if you want. I hate myself for it in spite of what he was, in spite of what he did to me. Oh, poor little man. Your papa was mean to you. Do you have any idea what you did when you fired that crossbow? You left us open. You laid us bare for the vultures, and the vultures came and tore us apart. You may not have killed Joffrey, but you killed Myrcella, you killed Tommen. No one would've touched them if Father was here. - No one would have dared - I have never been more sorry about anything. I will not hear it, not from you. I will not hear it! All right. You love your family, and I have destroyed it. I will always be a threat. So put an end to me. If it weren't for me, you'd have a mother. If it weren't for me, you'd have a father. If it weren't for me, you'd have two beautiful children. I've thought about killing you more times than I can count. Do it! Say the word. (SIGHS) (PANTS) I am more sorry about the children than you could ever know. - I will not - I don't care. I loved them. You know I did. You know it in your heart if there's anything left of it. It doesn't matter. Your love doesn't matter. Your feelings don't matter. I don't care why you did what you did. I only care what it cost us. It cost us our future. If there's no future, then why are we here? Why did you allow me to come? Not to help my enemies collaborate in my destruction. Yes, no, not what you hoped for, but you must have hoped for something. What did you hope for? - To make Jon Snow submit to your queen? - Mm, not like this. But eventually, you want everyone to bend the knee to her. - Yes. - Why? Because I think she will make the world a better place. You said she'd destroy King's Landing. She knows herself. She chose an advisor who would check her worst impulses instead of feeding them. That's the difference between you. I don't care about checking my worst impulses. I don't care about making the world a better place. Hang the world. That thing you dragged here, I know what it is, I know what it means. And when it came at me, I didn't think about the world. Not at all. As soon as it opened its mouth, the world disappeared for me, right down its black throat. All I could think about was keeping those gnashing teeth away from the ones who matter most, away from my family. Maybe Euron Greyjoy had the right idea. Get on a boat, take those who matter You're pregnant. (SIGHS) No one is less happy about this than I am. I know. I respect what you did. Wish you hadn't done it, but I respect it. This place was the beginning of the end for my family. (SPEAKING VALYRIAN) A dragon is not a slave. They were terrifying. Extraordinary. They filled people with wonder and awe, and we locked them in here. They wasted away. They grew small. And we grew small as well. We weren't extraordinary without them. We were just like everyone else. You're not like everyone else. And your family hasn't seen its end. You're still here. I can't have children. Who told you that? The witch who murdered my husband. Has it occurred to you she might not have been a reliable source of information? You were right from the beginning. If I had trusted you, everything would be different. So, what now? I can't forget what I saw north of the Wall. And I can't pretend that Cersei won't take back half the country the moment I march north. It appears Tyrion's assessment was correct. We're fucked. (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) My armies will not stand down. I will not pull them back to the capital. I will march them north to fight alongside you in the Great War. The darkness is coming for us all. We'll face it together. And when the Great War is over, perhaps you'll remember I chose to help with no promises or assurances from any of you. I expect not. Call our banners. All of them."
10045,5,6,LITTLEFINGER,"It's not easy for ravens to fly in these storms. Perhaps Jon tried to send word earlier. No, this is the way he is, the way he's always been. He never asked for my opinion. Why would he start now? I can't believe he'd surrender the Northern crown without consulting you. This is his writing, his signature. He pledged to fight for Daenerys Targaryen. He's bent the knee. I've heard gossip that the Dragon Queen is quite beautiful. What does that have to do with anything? Jon is young and unmarried. Daenerys is young and unmarried. You think he wants to marry her? An alliance makes sense. Together, they'd be difficult to defeat. He was named King in the North. He can be unnamed. Even if I wanted to, Arya would never go along. She always loved Jon far more than she ever loved me, and she'd kill anyone who betrayed her family. You are family, too. Would Arya really murder her own sister? Do you know what she is now? Do you know what the Faceless Men are? Only by reputation. They worship the God of Death, I believe. I never trust godly men. They're killers. And Arya was one of them. What do you think she's after? She's your sister. You know her far better than I ever could. Sometimes when I try to understand a person's motives, I play a little game. I assume the worst. What's the worst reason they could possibly have for saying what they say and doing what they do? Then I ask myself, ""How well does that reason explain what they say and what they do?"" So, tell me what's the worst thing she could want? She could want me dead because she thinks I wronged my family. Why did she come to Winterfell? To kill me for marrying our enemies and betraying my family. Why did she unearth the letter Cersei made you write? To provide proof of my betrayals. To provide justification after she murders me. And after she murders you, what does she become? Lady of Winterfell. (WAVES CRASHING) If we have the Dothraki ride hard on the kingsroad, they'll arrive at Winterfell within the fortnight. And the Unsullied? We can sail with them to White Harbor, meet the Dothraki here on the kingsroad, then ride together to Winterfell. Perhaps you should fly to Winterfell, Your Grace. You have many enemies in the North. Thousands fell fighting your father. All it takes is one angry man with a crossbow. He'll see your silver hair on the kingsroad and know that one well-placed bolt will make him a hero. The man who killed the conqueror."
10046,5,6,JON,"It's your decision, Your Grace. But if we're going to be allies in this war, it's important for the Northerners to see us as allies. If we sail to White Harbor together, I think it sends a better message. I've not come to conquer the North. I'm coming to save the North. We sail together. Jon. Can I speak with you? All right. What you did in King's Landing, what you said you could've lied to Cersei about bending the knee to Daenerys. You risked everything to tell an enemy the truth. We went down there to make peace. And it seems to me we need to be honest with each other if we're going to fight together. You've always known what was right. Even when we were all young and stupid, you always knew. Every step you take it's always the right step. It's not. It may seem that way from the outside, but I promise you, it's not true. I've done plenty of things that I regret. Not compared to me, you haven't. No. Not compared to you. I always wanted to do the right thing. Be the right kind of person. But I never knew what that meant. It always seemed like there's like there was an impossible choice I had to make. Stark or Greyjoy. Our father was more of a father to you than yours ever was. - He was. - And you betrayed him. Betrayed his memory. I did. (SIGHS) But you never lost him. He's a part of you. Just like he's a part of me. But the things I've done It's not my place to forgive you for all of it. But what I can forgive, I do. You don't need to choose. You're a Greyjoy and you're a Stark. When I was Ramsay's prisoner, Yara tried to save me. She's the only one who tried to save me. (SNIFFLES) She needs me now."
10047,5,6,HARRAG,"Load up. Load up, lads. Go on. - (CHATTER) - Tide's coming in. All of us chose to follow Yara. We left the Iron Islands for Yara. She would never leave one of us behind. We're not leaving her behind. Your sister's dead. - She's not dead. - She's dead. Even if Euron hasn't cut her throat yet, she's dead. - She's our queen. - She's your sister, and you left her to die. I did. I ran from my uncle. I was a coward. So, why in fuck's name should we listen to you? They say the dead can't swim. We're going to sail east, find a nice, quiet island, kill all the men, and take their wives for ourselves. - We're done with all that. - Who says we are? Yara did. She made a pledge. We're going to find her, and we're going to set her free. - (SPITS) - (MEN LAUGH) Run away, little Theon. It's what you do best."
10048,5,6,MAN,He needs to shut his mouth.
10049,5,6,MAN,"Hey! - (MEN LAUGHING) - (SHOUTS) - MAN #2: Oh, yes! - MAN #3: That's more like it. - (MEN LAUGHING) (GRUNTS) Stay down or I'll kill you! (GRUNTS) I said stay down or I'll kill you! (SHOUTING) (GRUNTING) (GRUNTS) (SHOUTS) (GRUNTING) (PANTS) Not for me."
10050,5,6,MEN,"Yara! Have my sister brought to the Great Hall. Are you sure you want to do this? It's not what I want. It's what honor demands. And what does honor demand? That I defend my family from those who would harm us. That I defend the North from those who would betray us. All right, then. Get on with it. You stand accused of murder. You stand accused of treason. How do you answer these charges Lord Baelish? My sister asked you a question. Lady Sansa, forgive me I'm a bit confused. Which charges confuse you? Let's start with the simplest one you murdered our aunt, Lysa Arryn. You pushed her through the Moon Door and watched her fall. Do you deny it? I did it to protect you. You did it to take power in the Vale. Earlier, you conspired to murder Jon Arryn. You gave Lysa Tears of Lys to poison him. Do you deny it? Whatever your aunt might have told you she was a troubled woman. She imagined enemies everywhere. You had Aunt Lysa send a letter to our parents telling them it was the Lannisters who murdered Jon Arryn when, really, it was you. The conflict between the Starks and the Lannisters, it was you who started it. Do you deny it? I know of no such letter. You conspired with Cersei Lannister and Joffrey Baratheon to betray our father, Ned Stark. Thanks to your treachery, he was imprisoned and later executed on false charges of treason. - Do you deny it? - I deny it! None of you were there to see what happened. None of you knows the truth. You held a knife to his throat. You said, ""I did warn you not the trust me. "" You told our mother this knife belonged to Tyrion Lannister. But that was another one of your lies. It was yours. Lady Sansa, I have known you since you were a girl. - I've protected you. - Protected me? By selling me to the Boltons? If we could speak alone, I can explain everything. Sometimes when I'm trying to understand a person's motives, I play a little game. I assume the worst. What's the worst reason you have for turning me against my sister? That's what you do, isn't it? That's what you've always done turn family against family, turn sister against sister. That's what you did to our mother and Aunt Lysa, and that's what you tried to do to us. Sansa, please. I'm a slow learner, it's true. But I learn. Give me a chance to defend myself. I deserve that. I am Lord Protector of the Vale and I command you to escort me safely back to the Eyrie. I think not. Sansa, I beg you! I loved your mother since the time I was a boy. And yet, you betrayed her. I loved you. More than anyone. And yet, you betrayed me. When you brought me back to Winterfell, you told me there's no justice in the world, not unless we make it. Thank you for all your many lessons, Lord Baelish. I will never forget them."
10051,5,6,JAIME,Our men in King's Landing will march north in three days' time.
10052,5,6,MAN,It'll take us a fortnight just to gather supplies for the train.
10053,5,6,JAIME,"We don't have a fortnight. If the North falls, we fall. Three days. The remaining forces in the Westerlands will take the river road east. We'll meet at Lord Harroway's Town and march together to Winterfell. Ser Jaime. Your Grace. My lords, I need a moment with my brother."
10054,5,6,MEN,"Your Grace. - What are you doing? - Preparing the expedition north. Expedition north? I always knew you were the stupidest Lannister. The Starks and Targaryens have united against us, and you want to fight alongside them? Are you a traitor or an idiot? You pledged our forces to fight our common enemy I'll say whatever I need to say to ensure the survival of our house. You expect me to trust the man who murdered our father? You expect me to command our troops to fight beside foreign scum, to fight for the Dragon Queen? You saw it with your own eyes. You saw a dead man trying to kill us. I saw it burn. If dragons can't stop them, if Dothraki and Unsullied and Northmen can't stop them, how will our armies make a difference? This isn't about noble houses, this is about the living and the dead! And I intend to stay amongst the living. Let the Stark boy and his new queen defend the North. We stay here where we've always been. I made a promise. Our child will rule Westeros. Our child will never be born if the dead come south. The monsters are real. The white walkers, the dragons, the Dothraki screamers all the frightening stories we heard when we were young, they're all real. So be it. Let the monsters kill each other. And while they battle in the North, we take back the lands that belong to us. - And then what? - And then we rule. When the fighting in the North is over, someone wins. You understand that, don't you? If the dead win, they march south and kill us all. If the living win, and we've betrayed them, they march south and kill us all! The Targaryens and the Starks already want to kill us all. Most of them will die in the North. I faced them in the field. We can't beat them. We can't beat their dragons. How many dragons did you see at the pit? - Two. - What happened to the third? For all we know, it's guarding her fleet! She came here with her dragons and her Dothraki and her Unsullied. She came here to show us all her power. No, something happened. The dragons are vulnerable. We can't beat the Dothraki. We don't have the numbers. We don't have the support of the other houses! No, we have something better. We have the Iron Bank. You should've listened more when Father spoke about the importance of gold. Oh, I know it's boring for you. You just wanted to hunt and ride and fight. But I listened, I learned. Highgarden bought us the most powerful army in Essos the Golden Company. 20,000 men, horses, elephants, I believe. The Golden Company is not here. They're in Essos. How is a mercenary company in Essos going to help us? Do you really think Euron Greyjoy turned tail and sailed back to the Iron Islands? Do you think he abandoned the chance to marry the queen? No one walks away from me. He's sailing with his fleet to Essos. He's going to ferry the Golden Company back here to help us win the war for Westeros. You plotted with Euron Greyjoy without telling me, the commander of your armies? And you conspired with Tyrion, the man who murdered our father, without telling me, your queen. I didn't conspire with him. You met with him in secret without my consent. You planned to promote my enemies' interests. That is the definition of conspiracy. I pledged to ride north. I intend to honor that pledge. - And that will be treason. - Treason? Disobeying your queen's command, fighting with her enemies. What would you call it? Doesn't matter what I'd call it. I told you no one walks away from me. Are you going to order him to kill me? I'm the only one you have left. Our children are gone, our father is gone. It's just me and you now. There's one more yet to come. Give the order, then. I don't believe you. (CHATTER) - (KNOCKING ON DOOR) - Come in. Samwell Tarly. I wasn't sure if you'd remember me. I remember everything. (DOOR CLOSES) You helped us get beyond the Wall. - You're a good man. - Oh, well, thank you, but, um, I'm not sure that I am. What happened to you beyond the Wall? I became the Three-Eyed Raven. Oh! I don't know what that means. I can see things that happened in the past. I can see things happening now all over the world. Why did you come to Winterfell? Um Jon's the one to lead the fight against the dead. I know he is. But he can't do it alone, so I've come here to help him. He's on his way back to Winterfell with Daenerys Targaryen. You you saw this in in a vision? Oh. He needs to know the truth. The truth about what? About himself. No one knows. No one but me. Jon isn't really my father's son. He's the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and my aunt, Lyanna Stark. He was born in a tower in Dorne. His last name isn't really Snow, it's Sand. It's not. Dornish bastards are named Sand. At the Citadel, I transcribed a High Septon's diary. He annulled Rhaegar's marriage to Elia. He wed Rhaegar and Lyanna in a secret ceremony. Are you certain? It's what the High Septon wrote in his private diary. I don't know why he'd lie. Is this something you can see? Rhaegar and Lyanna: Father, Smith, Warrior, Mother, Maiden, Crone, Stranger. - I am hers and she is mine - I am his and he is mine from this day until the end of my days."
10055,5,6,VOICE,Robert's Rebellion was built on a lie. Rhaegar didn't kidnap my aunt or rape her. He loved her. And she loved him.
10056,5,6,VOICE,"And Jon - (BABY CRYING) Jon's real name His name is Aegon Targaryen. You have to protect him. Promise me, Ned."
10057,5,6,VOICE,He's never been a bastard.
10058,5,6,VOICE,He's the heir to the Iron Throne.
10059,5,6,VOICE,"He needs to know. We need to tell him. Are you all right? It's just strange. In his own horrible way, I believe he loved me. You did the right thing. You did it. I'm just the executioner. You passed the sentence. You're the Lady of Winterfell. Does that bother you? I was never going to be as good a lady as you. So I had to be something else. I never could have survived what you survived. You would have. You're the strongest person I know. I believe that's the nicest thing you've ever said to me. Well, don't get used to it. You're still very strange and annoying. ""In winter, we must protect ourselves. Look after one another. "" Father. ""When the snows fall and the white winds blow, the lone wolf dies, but the pack survives. "" I miss him. Me, too."
10060,5,6,BERIC,It's a long way down. Yeah. The crows keep telling me I'll get used to it.
