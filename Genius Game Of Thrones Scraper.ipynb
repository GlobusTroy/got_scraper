The crown accepts your truce. Until the dead are defeated, they are the true enemy. (SIGHS) In return, the King in the North will extend this truce. He will remain in the North where he belongs. He will not take up arms against the Lannisters. He will not choose sides.  \n",

Why would he start now? I can't believe he'd surrender the Northern crown without consulting you. This is his writing, his signature. He pledged to fight for Daenerys Targaryen. He's bent the knee. I've heard gossip that the Dragon Queen is quite beautiful. What does that have to do with anything? Jon is young and unmarried. Daenerys is young and unmarried. You think he wants to marry her? An alliance makes sense. Together, they'd be difficult to defeat. He was named King in the North. He can be unnamed. Even if I wanted to, Arya would never go along.

You pledged our forces to fight our common enemy I'll say whatever I need to say to ensure the survival of our house. You expect me to trust the man who murdered our father? You expect me to command our troops to fight beside foreign scum, to fight for the Dragon Queen? You saw it with your own eyes. You saw a dead man trying to kill us. I saw it burn. If dragons can't stop them, if Dothraki and Unsullied and Northmen can't stop them, how will our armies make a difference? This isn't about noble houses, this is about the living and the dead! And I intend to stay amongst the living. Let the Stark boy and his new queen defend the North. We stay here where we've always been. I made a promise. Our child will rule Westeros.
