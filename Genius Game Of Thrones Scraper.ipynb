      "I saw Craster take his own baby boy and leave it in the woods. I saw what took it.\n",
      "Because when I told the Lord Commander, he already knew. Thousands of years ago, the First Men battled the White Walkers and defeated them. I want to fight for the side that fights for the living. Did I come to the right place?\n",
      "They stabbed me . Olly...he put a knife in my heart . I shouldn’t be here .\n",
      "Nothing . There was nothing at all .\n",

      "I think so . Hold off on burning my body for now . DOLOROUS EDD laughs.\n",
      "If you have any last words, now is the time .\n",
      "Neither was killing me .\n",
      "I’m sure you would, Ser Alliser .\n",

      "They killed me, Edd! My own brothers . You want me to stay here after that? A single horn sounds outside. JON SNOW and DOLOROUS EDD look to the doorway. MAN (O.S.): Riders approaching! MAN #2 (O.S.): Open the gate!\n",
      "With the peas and onions?\n",
      "We never should have left Winterfell .\n",
      "How could we know?\n",
      "We were children .\n",

      "There’s nothing to forgive .\n",
      "All right . All right, I forgive you . SANSA laughs, then holds out her hand for JON SNOW’s horn of ale. JON SNOW gives it to her. She sips, then coughs. JON SNOW laughs.\n",

      "I’m not Lord Commander anymore. JON SNOW takes the letter. The man leaves. JON SNOW sees the seal of House Bolton. He opens the scroll and starts reading.\n",
      "\"To the traitor and bastard Jon Snow. You allowed thousands of wildlings past the Wall. You have betrayed your own kind. You have betrayed the North. Winterfell is mine, bastard. Come and see. Your brother Rickon is in my dungeon. JON SNOW looks at SANSA.\n",
      "His direwolf's skin is on my floor. Come and see. I want my bride back. Send her to me, bastard, and I will not trouble you or your wildling lovers. Keep her from me and I will ride north and slaughter every wildling man, woman, and babe living under your protection. You will watch as I skin them living. You --\n",
      "It's just more of the same. JON SNOW puts the letter away, but SANSA takes it and continues reading.\n",
      "Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North.\n",
      "We don’t know that.\n",
      "We can’t defend the north from the Walkers and the south from the Boltons. If we want to survive, we need Winterfell, and to take Winterfell, we need more men.\n",
      "There are more than three other houses in the North -- Glover, Mormont, Cerwyn, Mazin, Hornwood. Two dozen more. Together they equal all the others. We can start small and build.\n",
      "How do you know that?\n",
      "New dress?\n",

      "Thank you, Sansa.\n",
      "Don’t knock it down while I’m gone.\n",
      "That’s what’ll happen to you if we lose. The Boltons, the Karstarks, the Umbers, they know you’re here. They know that more than half of you are women and children. After they finish with me, they’ll come for you. You’re right. This isn’t your fight. You shouldn’t have to come to Winterfell with me. I shouldn’t be asking you. It’s not the deal we made. I need you with me if we’re gonna beat them, and we need to beat them if you’re going to survive. TORMUND gestures to JON SNOW.\n",
      "Lady Mormont.\n",
      "I served under your uncle at Castle Black, Lady Lyanna. He was also a great warrior and an honorable man. I was his steward. In fact- -\n",
      "Stannis Baratheon garrisoned at Castle Black before he marched on Winterfell and was killed. He showed me the letter you wrote to him when he petitioned for men. It said- -\n",
      "Robb is gone, but House Stark is not. And it needs your support now more than ever. I’ve come with my sister to ask for House Mormont’s allegiance. LYANNA leans towards her maester. They whisper to each other. LYANNA turns back to face JON SNOW.\n",
      "Ramsay Bolton cannot be allowed to keep Winterfell, my lady. It is our duty to stop him. Even more so because he holds our brother Rickon Stark as prisoner. What you have to understand, my lady, is that- -\n",
      "Your uncle fought them at the Fist of the First Men. I fought them at Hardhome. We both lost.\n",
      "Thank you, my lady. How many fighting men can we expect? LYANNA leans to her military commander and they whisper to each other.\n",
      "62?\n",
      "Lord Glover, if you could just hear us out.\n",
      "The Boltons are traitors. Roose Bolton- -\n",
      "House Mormont.\n",
      "We sent raven to Houses Manderly- -\n",
      "The bulk of the force is made up of wildlings. ROBETT laughs.\n",
      "Lord Glover.\n",
      "We’re not staying here long. Another storm could hit any day..\n",
      "We have to march on Winterfell now while we still can. They all dismount their horses and begin walking side by side.\n",
      "Ser Davos is the reason I’m standing here talking to you and he served Stannis for years.\n",
      "There’s no time.\n",
      "We fight with the army we have. JON SNOW looks over SANSA’s shoulder at DAVOS. He is standing in front of the fighting men, who are wrestling on the ground.\n",
      "You don’t have to be here.\n",
      "You’re right. There’s no need for a battle. Thousands of men don’t need to die. Only one of us. Let’s end this the old way. You against me. RAMSAY chuckles.\n",
      "Aye, you have the numbers. Will your men want to fight for you when they hear you wouldn’t fight for them? RAMSAY points at JON SNOW.\n",
      "If he was smart, he’d stay inside the walls of Winterfell and wait us out.\n",
      "It’s his weakness, too. His mean don’t want to fight for him. They’re forced to fight for him. If they feel the tide turning...\n",
      "We’re digging trenches all along our flanks. They won’t be able to hit us the way that Stannis hit you, in a double envelopment. TORMUND stares blankly at JON SNOW.\n",
      "A pincer move. TORMUND stares blankly at JON SNOW. JON SNOW and DAVOS look at each other briefly.\n",
      "They won’t be able to hit us from the sides.\n",
      "No. But I wanted to make him angry. I want him coming at us full tilt.\n",
      "Aye, for what they’re worth.\n",
      "You’re right.\n",
      "He’s overconfident.\n",
      "Aye, and what have I been doing all my life? Playing with broomsticks? I fought beyond the Wall against worse than Ramsay Bolton. I’ve defended the Wall from worse than Ramsay Bolton.\n",
      "All right, tell me. What should we do? How do we get Rickon back?\n",
      "We can’t give up on our brother.\n",
      "Of course he does. What should I do differently?\n",
      "Aye, that’s good advice.\n",
      "Well, it is a bit obvious.\n",
      "When will we have a larger force?! We’ve pleaded with every house that’ll have us! The Blackfish can’t help us! We’re lucky to have this many men!\n",
      "Now, it’s not enough! It’s what we have! Battles have been won against greater odds.\n",
      "My lady. You weren’t at the war council.\n",
      "Any advice?\n",
      "If I do, if I fall, don’t bring me back.\n",
      "I’m ordering you not to bring me back.\n",
      "You’re in my camp. I’m the commander.\n",
      "How do you know what he commands?\n",
      "Why?\n",
      "What kind of god would do something like that?\n",
      "Get word -- The Stark footsoldier is taken in the head by an arrow. JON SNOW stares down at the man and then flies into a rage, killing two more Bolton soldiers. A third man runs at him but is knocked down by a galloping horse. JON SNOW runs over to where he landed and stabs him several times. A horseman gallops at JON SNOW with his ax ready, but a passing Stark cavalryman spears him. Another Bolton footsoldier approaches JON SNOW, but JON SNOW cuts him down. The bodies are beginning to pile up on the battlefield. RAMSAY’s archers loose several more volleys. JON SNOW goes into a frenzy, killing many Bolton men. The bodies have piled up high enough to create small mountains of bodies. Men continue to fight atop and around them.\n",
      "We’re going to bury my brother in the crypt next to my father. The stretcher men continue on. JON SNOW turns to walk away.\n",
      "When we had feasts, our family would sit up here… and I’d sit down there. JON SNOW points to the other end of the hall.\n",
      "Aye, you’re right. I was luckier than most. DAVOS enters the hall and tosses the charred stag statuette at MELISANDRE. MELISANDRE catches it.\n",
      "What is that?\n",
      "Ride south today. If you return to the North, I’ll have you hanged as a murderer. MELISANDRE puts the stag statuette down on the high table and begins to walk away. DAVOS moves in her way.\n",
      "I’m having the lord’s chamber prepared for you.\n",
      "I’m not a Stark.\n",
      "You’re the Lady of Winterfell. You deserve it. We’re standing here because of you. The battle was lost until the Knights of the Vale rode in. They came because of you. You told me Lord Baelish sold you to the Boltons.\n",
      "And you trust him?\n",
      "We need to trust each other. We can’t fight a war amongst ourselves. We have so many enemies now. JON SNOW touches SANSA’s face and kisses her on the forehead, then turns to walk away.\n",
      "Well, Father always promised, didn’t he? JON SNOW exits. SANSA looks out at the wilderness. EXT. SUNSPEAR - COURTYARD ELLARIA SAND and OLENNA TYRELL are sitting across a table from each other. OBARA SAND, NYMERIA SAND, and TYENE SAND flank ELLARIA.\n",
      "The free folk, the northerners, and the Knights of the Vale fought bravely, fought together, and we won. My father uses to say we find our true friends on the battlefield. One of the houses’ representatives stands.\n",

      "Having a rough time of it?\n",

      "No it doesn't sound a bit mad, it's impossible.\n",
      "Sam we can't take her -\n",
      "It's just not possible.\n",
      "If it's a boy what? (Gilly looks around and then down, not answering). You want us to risk our lives for you, and you won't even tell us why. Gilly looks taken aback, and then runs off.\n",
      "Do what, ask her a question?\n",
      "Cruel! Sam are you in such a hurry to lose a hand?\n",
      "No you just want to steal her. What do you think Craster cuts off for that?\n",
      "We're heading deeper and deeper into wildling territory. We can't take a girl with us. Mormont wouldn't have it. And even if he would, what would we do with her? Who's gonna deliver her baby? You?\n",
      "I'm sorry Sam, we can't help her. Jon sits back down, and returns to sharpening his sword. Sam walks away. When Sam is gone, Jon sighs deeply.\n",
      "Lord Commander\n",
      "I followed him. He took the baby into the woods, the newborn.\n",
      "No, you don't understand. He's killing them, all the boys. JEOR stares back mutely.\n",
      "You know.\n",
      "Offerings? He's murdering his own children. He's a monster.\n",
      "I saw it. I saw something take that child.\n",
      "When will he come?\n",
      "My uncle told me stories about him.\n",
      "I heard the Halfhand spent half of last winter beyond the Wall.\n",
      "So it is possible for someone to survive out here on their own.\n",
      "I think they were afraid. I think they came here to get away from something. And I don't think it worked. A horn sounds, and the men pause from their labor to see what is going on.\n",
      "One blast is for rangers returning. Wildlings is two blasts.\n",

      "What's your name?\n",
      "I'm Jon Snow. JON stands back but keeps his blade trained on YGRITTE's face. She looks at the fallen wildlings.\n",
      "No. No, I'll do it.\n",
      "I'm as much a crow as they are. YGRITTE rolls onto her stomach, accepting her fate. JON positions his sword above the back of her neck.\n",
      "Can't. Someone might see the smoke. YGRITTE pulls her hood back in frustration. She wants a clean death. JON rests the sword on the back of her neck.\n",
      "I'll find them.\n",
      "We'll stop here. Too dark to go any farther today.\n",
      "There's no shelter anywhere.\n",

      "No fire.\n",

      "I'm a man of the Night's Watch.\n",
      "Don't call them that.\n",
      "Neither. Both. Having checked her bindings, he picks up his sword and leads her off.\n",
      "Move!\n",
      "There are no women of the Night's Watch, no.\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Never. We swore an oath.\n",
      "Would you please shut up?\n",
      "You're a free woman? I might be your prisoner, but I'm a free woman.\n",
      "If you're my prisoner, you're not a free woman. That's what \"prisoner\" means.\n",
      "It was my choice to say the words.\n",
      "Of course I like girls. But you chose never to touch them.\n",
      "That's the price you pay if you want to be a man of the Night's Watch.\n",
      "Invade your lands? Wildlings raid our lands all the time. Some of them tried to kill my little brother, a crippled boy!\n",
      "My father was Ned Stark. I have the blood of the First Men. My ancestors lived here, same as yours.\n",
      "No. No, you serve Mance Rayder, the King beyond the Wall.\n",

      "What?\n",
      "I didn't.\n",
      "Careful with that. You might cut yourself. YGRITTE swings the sword again, JON feints and she misses.\n",
      "Never swung a sword before, have you? You look like a baby with a rattle.\n",
      "Stop! Two wildlings hold QHORIN back.\n",

      "Don't think too much, Bran. Suddenly, JON and ROBB are by his side.\n",

      "No.\n",

      "1000 men Orell stands up.\n",
      "I don't need you to protect me.\n",
      "Give it back. She stops by the fire and picks up a torch.\n",

      "Ygritte! Seven hells. Ygritte!\n",
      "Ygritte.\n",
      "We shouldn't.\n",
      "I don't know. I just wanted to kiss you there is all.\n",
      "You seemed to like it.\n",
      "There's been no one else. Only you.\n",
      "I was a man of the Night's Watch. How about you? Were you a maid?\n",
      "Who was he?\n",
      "Yeah, thanks. I think I've heard enough. We'd best get back. Tormund-- YGRITTE sits astride JON.\n",
      "You ever climbed it before?\n",
      "Aren't you?\n",
      "You kill someone for them?\n",
      "Can we not talk about that here?\n",
      "Did I seem scared the other day?\n",
      "Only in the beginning.\n",
      "What secret?\n",
      "I won't.\n",

      "(grunts)\n",
      "(grunts)\n",
      "Take my hand! They strain to connect, then clasp hands. JON pulls YGRITTE up to safety. They embrace, panting and exhausted. JON looks up to the sneering ORELL. They all begin to climb again.\n",
      "About a week, I think.\n",
      "When we went to Castle Black, we took the kingsroad. JON and YGRITTE sit. She adjusts her boots.\n",
      "Most of the time, yes.\n",
      "They don't, really. It's a great honor to carry your house sigil.\n",
      "Usually it's the young boys banging the drums.\n",
      "They help the men march.\n",
      "Well, it's-- it's the rhythm. YGRITTE stands up and play-acts a silly march.\n",
      "No. No, you're just gonna light the biggest fire the North has ever seen to let them know you're coming.\n",
      "I know you cut me loose on the Wall.\n",
      "And are you gonna share it with me? The deep wisdom you found inside the head of a bird?\n",
      "You're gonna scare it off.\n",
      "It's too far away.\n",
      "It's a windmill.\n",
      "Just the men who used to live here.\n",
      "Winterfell has towers three times that size.\n",
      "If you're impressed by a windmill, you'd be swooning if you saw the Great Keep at Winterfell.\n",
      "Fainting.\n",
      "When a girl sees blood and collapses.\n",
      "Well not all girls are like you.\n",
      "I'd like to see you in a silk dress. She punches him playfully.\n",
      "So I could tear it off you.\n",
      "Maybe one day I'll take you to Winterfell.\n",
      "Ygritte. You won't win. I know your people are brave, no one denies that.\n",
      "Six times in the last thousand years, a King has attacked the kingdoms. Six times they failed.\n",
      "Every boy in the North knows it. We grow up learning it. Where the battles were fought, the names of the heroes, who died where. Six times you've invaded and six times you've failed. The seventh will be the same.\n",
      "You don't have the discipline. You don't have the training. Your army is no army. You don't know how to fight together.\n",
      "I do. I know it. If you attack the Wall, you'll die. All of you.\n",
      "Yes, first we'll live. They kiss again.\n",
      "He breeds them for the Watch.\n",
      "The Watch protects him.\n",
      "We just take the horses and go.  The old man’s no threat.\n",
      "The Watch might send a few men looking for a horse thief.  They’ll send a lot more to hunt down murderers.\n",
      "Ygritte!\n",
      "You were right the whole time.\n",
      "Ygritte, you know I didn't have a choice. You always knew who I was, what I am.\n",
      "I have to go home now. I know you won't hurt me. YGRITTE's emotions start to crack.\n",
      "I do know some things. I know I love you. YGRITTE grunts and draws her bow harder in rage.\n",
      "I know you love me. But I have to go home now. YGRITTE fights back tears. JON turns, and she looses an arrow into  Jon's shoulder. Jon falls to the ground, grunting in pain. YGRITTE notches another arrow as JON lurches up and grabs onto his horse. YGRITTE hesitates. JON mounts and YGRITTE puts an arrow into his leg. JON cries out and spurs his horse. YGRITTE has found her resolve. She notches another arrow. She tracks him and shoots him a third time as he gallops away. She begins to weep.\n",
      "Pyp? Sam?\n",
      "Last time I saw him, he was in the courtyard at Winterfell. \"He said, \" Next time I see you, you'll be all in black.\" I was jealous of Robb my whole life. (Winces) The way my father looked at him, I wanted that. He was better than me at everything... fighting and hunting and riding and girls. Gods, the girls loved him. I wanted to hate him, but I never could.\n",
      "(Chuckles)\n",
      "He's wanted to hang me for a while. Now's his chance.\n",
      "I've done plenty wrong. INT. Winterfell. ALLISER THORNE questions JON SNOW. He is flanked by JANOS SLYNT and MAESTRE AEMON\n",
      "I didn't murder him.\n",
      "He wanted me to kill him.\n",
      "The Halfhand believed our only chance to stop Mance was to get a man inside his army.\n",
      "Then you'd know he'd do anything to defend the Wall. The free folk would have boiled him alive, but letting me kill him...\n",
      "Aye, I talk like a wildling. I ate with the wildlings. I climbed the Wall with the wildlings. I... I laid with a wildling girl.\n",
      "I do.\n",
      "While we sit here debating which rules I broke, Mance Rayder marches on the Wall with an army of 100,000.\n",
      "100,000. He's united the Thenns, the Hornfoots, the ice-river clans. He has giants fighting for him.\n",
      "Have you ever been beyond the Wall, ser?\n",
      "And now you're here. You must not have been very good at your job. JANOS SLYNT stands in indignation.\n",
      "There's a band of wildlings south of the Wall already led by Tormund Giantsbane. I killed their warg and three others. They shot me full of arrows. Their orders are to attack Castle Black from the south when Mance hits it from the north. The signal for the attack will be a bonfire. Mance said it would be the greatest fire the North has ever seen. That's the truth. All the truth. JANOS SLYNT sits back down.\n",
      "Do you intend to execute me or am I free to go?\n",
      "Mance Rayder is coming. If the wildlings breach the Wall, they'll roll over everything and everyone for 1,000 Miles before they reach an army that can stop them.\n",
      "Help him.\n",
      "And the mutineers stayed?\n",
      "We need to ride north and kill them all.\n",
      "It's not about justice. I told the wildlings we had over 1,000 men at Castle Black alone. Karl and the others know the truth as well as we do. How long do you think they'll keep that information to themselves when the wildlings are peeling their fingernails off? Mance has all he needs to crush us, he just doesn't know it yet. As soon as he gets his hands on them, he will. Then he'll throw his full strength at us. And even if every one of us kills 100 wildlings, there's still not a thing we can do to stop them.\n",
      "Bring it through! And again. JON and GRENN spar\n",
      "Very nice. Good. JON and GRENN take a break. JON speaks to the recruits.\n",
      "A lot of wildlings fight with a weapon in each hand. First thing you want to do is disarm them to try and even the odds. JON hands GRENN a second sword. They engage, and JON quickly knocks away one of GRENN's swords. GRENN takes a wide swing, JON ducks, then blocks his forearm and puts his blade to GRENN's throat. OLLY smiles in the crowd and GRENN nods, admitting defeat.\n",
      "Let's see what you can do. OLLY steps forward, ready.\n",
      "Olly, you just watch for now.\n",
      "Have you ever held a sword before? OLLY I was the best archer in our hamlet. The recruits laugh.\n",
      "You two. Take it slow,  try and disarm each other. LOCKE and another ranger arm themselves. LOCKE bests the bald one.\n",
      "You know how to fight. You could have gone easier on him.\n",
      "Grenn and I were helping them.\n",
      "Someone has to train them.\n",
      "My father was highborn. My mother wasn't.\n",
      "Jon Snow. They shake.\n",
      "You fight well.\n",
      "She wasn't safe here.\n",
      "Castle Black could be next.\n",
      "We have orders. No one's to leave the castle.\n",
      "And I remember who came after me and brought me home. I know how hard it is, Sam, believe me. When you told me about Bran going beyond the Wall, all I could think about was getting my strength back so I could go and find him.\n",
      "How fast could they travel? A crippled boy being pulled on a sledge by a simpleton?\n",
      "The wildlings have joined up with Mance. Every village or sheltered place will be deserted. Except... LOCKE enters\n",
      "Thank you, Ser Alliser. JON moves down to the main floor of the hall.\n",
      "Ahem, brothers. GRENN knocks against the table to get their attention. The hall quiets.\n",
      "I'm going beyond the Wallto Craster's Keep. I'm going to capture the mutineers holed up there or kill them. I'm asking for volunteers to come with me. There's 60 miles of wilderness between here and Craster's and Mance Rayder has an army bearing down on us, but we have to do this. Our survival may depend on us getting to these mutineers before Mance does. They know the Wall. They know our defenses. If Mance learns what they know, we're lost. But if that's not enough, then consider this. If the Night's Watch are truly brothers, then Lord Commander Mormont was our father. He lived and died for the Watch and he was betrayed by his own men. Stabbed in the back by cowards. He deserved far better. All we can give him now is justice. Who will join me? GRENN stands. JON Nods. DOLOROUS EDD stands. Three more join, and then LOCKE does.\n",
      "I can't let a recruit come north of the Wall.\n",
      "Thank you, brothers. INT. Craster's Keep, night. KARL TANNER drinks from a human skull while sounds of rough sex spill from the background.\n",
      "How many?\n",
      "Why?\n",
      "(SIGHS) Get some rest. We move at sundown.\n",
      "Are you all right? Come with me. Come on.\n",
      "We lost four brothers?\n",
      "I count 10 dead mutineers.\n",
      "Where in seven hells? Come here. Ghost whines. JON pets him.\n",
      "I missed you, boy.\n",
      "It's not safe for you here on your own. Mance Rayder has an army heading this way and there's worse out there than Mance. Come with us to Castle Black. We can find you work. Keep you safe.\n",
      "You want to stay here in Craster's Keep? MORAG spits.\n",
      "Greetings. MAN #3: Didn't think I'd see you again. JON and SAM hug.\n",
      "Come on, Ghost. INT. Castle Black Hall. The Night's Watch is gathered for a meeting. From the floor, JON addresses ALLISER THRONE who sits at the elevated table with JANOS SLYNT. First builder YARWICK also sits at the head table.\n",
      "Mance's army was closing in on Craster's Keep when we left. We saw their campfires from Osric's Hill. They'll reach the Wall before the next full moon.\n",
      "We need to prepare.\n",
      "We should seal the tunnel. Plug it with rocks and ice. Flood it and let it freeze.\n",
      "We wouldn't.\n",
      "Have you ever seen a giant, Ser Alliser? I have.\n",
      "They won't stop them.\n",
      "The stewards.\n",
      "No.\n",
      "The builders.\n",
      "You couldn't have known.\n",
      "We can't go after them, you know that. That's what they want.\n",
      "If they hit Mole's Town, then we're next. Mance's army must be close.\n",
      "She...she had red hair.\n",
      "Well what do you want me to say?\n",
      "So you and Gilly never-\n",
      "But if she had, you would've? You'd have broken your vows?\n",
      "What?\n",
      "I don't think Ser Alliser cares much for interpretation.\n",
      "It's...there's this person, this whole other person. And you're wrapped up in them and they're wrapped up in you and...you...for a little...for a little while you're more than just you, you're...well I don't know, I'm not a bleedin' poet!\n",
      "And what did I get for it? An arrow six inches from my heart.\n",
      "There will.\n",
      "Go get some sleep, Sam. I'll take this watch.\n",
      "There we go, boys. That's one. There's two. Come on, let's get the next lot. That's the last of the oil, Ser Alliser.\n",
      "Yes sir.\n",
      "It was a difficult decision either way, Ser.\n",
      "We can't just let them attack the gate!\n",
      "Those are giants riding mammoths down there. Do you think your cold, rolled steel's gonna stop them?\n",
      "Archers! Knock your arrows! Draw! Loose!\n",
      "They won't summit before dawn.\n",
      "Because I've made that claim .\n",
      "Knock! Draw! Loose!\n",
      "Now!\n",
      "*to Grenn* The outer gate won't hold. Take five men, hold the inner gate.\n",
      "*grabs Grenn's arm* Hold the gate. If they make it through...\n",
      "Oil!\n",
      "What are you doing up here?\n",
      "Ed. You have The Wall. If they try the mammoths again, drop fire on them. If the climbers get too high, drop the scythe on them.\n",
      "Two brothers now fight with me.\n",
      "*to Sam* I don't want you out there.\n",
      "I need him more than I need you.\n",
      "No, shh, don't talk.\n",
      "We'll go back there.\n",
      "Tormund. It's over, let it end.\n",
      "Put him in chains. We'll question him later.\n",
      "Aye, you should've.\n",
      "For one night.\n",
      "Great victory? Mance was testing our defenses. He almost made it through. And he has more giants, he has more mammoths. He has a thousand times as many men. They'll hit us again tonight. Maybe we can hold them off for a day or two, but we can never beat them.\n",
      "I'm going to find Mance.\n",
      "Who's left to give orders? The Wildling army is only an army because of Mance. He united a hundred warring tribes. Without Mance they lose their leader. They lose their purpose, they go back to fighting each other, scatter back to their home.\n",
      "I'm going to try.\n",
      "He'll kill me. If I don't go he'll kill me anyway. They'll kill the rest of us too.\n",
      "You're right. It's a bad plan. What's your plan?\n",
      "They held the gate. Get some brothers down here to help you. You need to burn the bodies. Raise the outer gate, then lower it again as soon as I'm out.\n",
      "I promised Jeor I'd never lose it again. *he hands the sword to Sam* In case I don't come back.\n",
      "I've been sent to negotiate with you .\n",
      "The Halfhand ordered me to join your army and bring back whatever information I could to Castle Black. He made me kill him so you'd trust me. I was loyal, to him and to my Night's Watch vows .\n",
      "She put three arrows in me when I escaped.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "She's dead.\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Ygritte.\n",
      "That's not wine.\n",
      "He's dead. He killed my friend Grenn.\n",
      "Grenn came from a farm.\n",
      "Grenn and Mag.\n",
      "Turn your army around and go home.\n",
      "I told Tormund and Orell. We have more than a thousand men.\n",
      "No, it's like you said, we don't have the men.\n",
      "I was sent to discuss terms with the king beyond the wall.\n",
      "I know he's the king. My father died for him. My name is Jon Snow, your grace. I'm Ned Stark's son.\n",
      "He was, your grace.\n",
      "I was this man's prisoner once. He could've tortured me, he could've killed me, but he spared my life. I think my father would've taken him prisoner, listened to what he had to say.\n",
      "Your grace. If my father'd seen the things that I've seen, he'd also tell you to burn the dead before nightfall. All of them.\n",
      "He's sworn to treat all wounded men, friend or foe.\n",
      "No one's going to torture you.\n",
      "I don't know what happens to the prisoners.\n",
      "I suppose Stannis does.\n",
      "I don't have a king.\n",
      "We're gonna burn the bodies of your dead. Do you want to say any words over them?\n",
      "Funeral words. I don't know how the Free Folk do it.\n",
      "Say farewell.\n",
      "She told you?\n",
      "Get your shield up.\n",
      "If it wasn’t heavy it wouldn’t stop a sword, now get it up. Jon knocks Olly into the ground then helps him up.\n",
      "Come. Try it again. Drive at me. Keep your shield up. Or I’ll ring your head like a bell. Sam and Gilly are watching them parry from afar.\n",
      "Good, good, pivot! Don’t forget to pivot! Shield up! Jon turns and sees Melisandre waiting.\n",
      "You’re not cold, my lady?\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Roose Bolton.\n",
      "I want a great many things, your grace. But I’m a sworn brother of the Night’s Watch now.\n",
      "They’re good men.\n",
      "It’s where she belonged.\n",
      "They were born on the wrong side of the wall. That doesn’t make them monsters.\n",
      "The men of the Night’s Watch are sworn to play no part--\n",
      "Your grace, you want the wildlings to march in your army?\n",
      "I don’t think that’s likely.\n",
      "I respect him.\n",
      "Your grace…\n",
      "How much time do I have?\n",
      "Here we are.\n",
      "This doesn’t have to be our last meeting.\n",
      "You know what Stannis wants?\n",
      "Shouldn’t a king be bold?\n",
      "You told me you weren’t here to conquer. You told me your people have bled enough.\n",
      "You spent your life convincing 90 clans to come together for the first time in history. Thenns and Hornfoots, the ice-river clans, even the giants. A life’s work uniting them. You didn’t do it for power. You didn’t do it for glory. You brought them together to save them because none of them will survive the winter, not if they’re north of the wall. Isn’t their survival more important than your pride?\n",
      "Then bend the knee and save your people.\n",
      "And how many tens of thousands are out there right now? How many women? How many children? And you won’t go out and rescue them because why? You’re afraid of looking afraid.\n",
      "They’ll burn you alive.\n",
      "And what happens to your people? You preserve your dignity and die standing, and they’ll sing songs about you. “You’d rather burn than kneel. The great hero.” Until winter comes, and the white walkers come for us all, and there’s no one left to sing.\n",
      "I think you’re making a terrible mistake.\n",
      "With respect, Your Grace, the free folk will never follow you, no matter what you do. You're the man who burned their king alive.\n",
      "No. Only one of their own.\n",
      "The Lord Commander's niece.\n",
      "\"Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North, whose name is Stark.\" (Jon smiles)\n",
      "I apologize, Your Grace. Northerners can be a bit like the free folk. Loyal to their own.\n",
      "Most likely.\n",
      "Unpleasant, I expect.\n",
      "I don't doubt it, Your Grace. But I'm a brother of the Night's Watch. I've pledged them my life, my honor, my sword. I don't know what I have left to give you.\n",
      "I can't. Even if I wanted to, I'm a bastard. A Snow.\n",
      "It's the first thing I ever remember wanting. I'd daydream that my father would ask the king, and just like that I would never be the bastard of Winterfell again.\n",
      "I'm going to refuse him. SAM (confused): But you'd be Lord of Winterfell.\n",
      "I swore a vow to the Night's Watch. If I don't take my own word seriously, what sort of Lord of Winterfell would I be? Jon walks away from Sam and takes a seat. ALLISER (O.S.): Crowded. You'd think we were serving venison stew. Maester Aemon rises slowly from the table at the front.\n",
      "(Stands up). Your Grace.\n",
      "Olly is my steward now, as I was Lord Commander Mormont's. I want him to attend my meetings, to learn from men with experience. One day, he might command.\n",
      "I have. And I thank you for it. You do me great honor. All my life I wanted to be Jon Stark.\n",
      "But I have to refuse you. I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. My place is here.\n",
      "I wish I could fight beside you. Believe me, I do. But I swore a sacred vow at the Godswood. I pledged my life to the Night's Watch.\n",
      "I can imagine no higher praise.\n",
      "May I ask, Your Grace, how long you plan to stay at Castle Black?\n",
      "You saved us from Mance Rayder's army. We will never forget that. But it's a question of survival. The Night's Watch can't continue to feed your men and the wildling prisoners indefinitely. Winter is coming.\n",
      "And the wildlings?\n",
      "Most of the brothers, yes. There's little love for the free folk here. (Olly stares at him).\n",
      "I heard it was best to keep your enemies close.\n",
      "I'm sorry I disappointed him. Davos walks forward and takes a seat. Olly closes the door again.\n",
      "As long as he's ruling them.\n",
      "I’ve sworn to stay clear of the politics of the Seven Kingdoms.\n",
      "And what needs to be done?\n",
      "Sam. (Sam looks up. Jon looks at Maester Aemon’s chair). Maester Aemon?\n",
      "Take good care of him. (To the group). Brothers. As you all know too well, it's long past time to dig a new latrine pit. (Laughter. Jon looks at Alliser). First Builder Yarwyck and I have decided to appoint a latrine captain to oversee this crucial task. (Laughter. After a moment, he continues). Brian. Seems like a good job for a ginger. Everyone laughs. Some of the men jokingly pat Brian on his back, and Brian laughs as well.\n",
      "Ser Alliser. (Silence). You have more experience than any other soldier at Castle Black. You proved your valour many times over, while defending the Wall from the wildling attack. I name you First Ranger. Some of the men shout in approval. Alliser looks up surprised. Edd and Sam look at each other. Janos pats him on the shoulder.\n",
      "Lord Janos. I'm giving you command of Greyguard.\n",
      "Yes, the fort is in a sorry state. Restore it as best you can. First Builder Yarwyck can spare ten of his -\n",
      "You mistake me, my Lord. That was a command, not an offer. Pack your arms and armour, say your farewells, and ride for Greyguard.\n",
      "Are you refusing to obey my order? The men in the room all turn to look at Janos.\n",
      "Take Lord Janos outside. The men begin to stand up. Janos scoffs.\n",
      "Olly, bring me my sword. Olly turns quickly to Jon, then gets up. Janos looks more unsure of himself as more men get up. Alliser turns and looks at Janos disapprovingly. Edd walks over to get Janos. Alliser stands in his way for a moment. Jon looks at the confrontation, worried. Alliser raises his eyebrows for a moment and moves out of the way. Janos looks at him shocked. Edd grabs Janos, and some other men assist in dragging him outside.\n",
      "If you have any last words, my Lord, now is the time.\n",
      "(To some of the men sparring). Good.\n",
      "Never even heard of these people.\n",
      "And how many men does this Lord Mazin have to send us?\n",
      "Not him.\n",
      "He murdered my brother.\n",
      "How can I help you?\n",
      "Castle Black is my home now. Night's Watch takes no part in the wars of the Seven Kingdoms.\n",
      "You're gonna show me some vision in the fire. Forgive me, my Lady. But I don't trust in visions.\n",
      "I don't think Stannis would like that very much.\n",
      "I can't.\n",
      "I swore a vow. (Melisandre looks at him incredulously). I loved another.\n",
      "I know. But I still love her. Melisandre stands up, closes her robes, and walks away. After opening the door to leave, she turns to Jon.\n",
      "Maester Aemon.\n",
      "Sam, I'd like to speak to the maester alone. Sam gets up, grabs his papers, and leaves. Jon walks over and sits at the table.\n",
      "How are you feeling?\n",
      "I need your advice. There's something I want to do, something I have to do. But it'll divide the Night's Watch. Bitterly. Half the men will hate me the moment I give the order.\n",
      "But you don't know what it is.\n",
      "Where are the rest of the free folk now? (Tormund scoffs). Where have they gone? (No response). Who leads them?\n",
      "What about you?\n",
      "What if I unchained you?\n",
      "Because you are not my enemy. And I'm not yours.\n",
      "For 8,000 years the Night's Watch have sworn an oath to be the shield that guards the realms of men. And for 8,000 years we've fallen short of that oath. You belong to the realms of men. All of you.\n",
      "It is.\n",
      "Because now, (Leans forward), I am Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.\n",
      "(Stands up). I'd have you go north of the Wall. Gather the remaining free folk wherever they are and bring them back here. I'll open the gates for them and let them through. I'll find them lands to settle south of the Wall.\n",
      "I don't want them to kneel for me. I want them to fight with me when the time comes.\n",
      "And how many of your people can't fight? The women, the children, the old, the sick, what happens to them? You're condemning them to death. Worse than death because you're too proud to make peace. Or maybe you're not proud. Maybe you're just a coward.\n",
      "Your people need a leader. And they need to get south of the Wall before it's too late. We don't have much time and they have less. The walkers are coming and they'll hit your people first. I'm not asking you to make peace to save your skin. Make peace to save your people.\n",
      "Up on Storrold's Point. I can give you 10 horses and nine other men. You can get there in a week.\n",
      "I'll talk to King Stannis about lending you his fleet.\n",
      "Men, women, and children will die by the thousands if we do nothing. MAN 1: Let them die. We got our own to worry about. Less enemies for us. Some of the men in the crowd cheer.\n",
      "And we've slaughtered theirs.\n",
      "You were at the Fist of the First Men. If we abandon them, you know what they become. We can learn to live with the wildlings or we can add them to the army of the dead. Whatever they are now, they're better than that. The men in the room return to bickering loudly. INT. LORD COMMANDER’S ROOM Jon walks in, takes off his coat, and puts his hands on his desk. Olly knocks and walks in with a plate of food, and sets it down.\n",
      "Thank you. (Olly walks away). Olly. (He stops). If you have something you want to say to me, say it. It's all right.\n",
      "It's not a trick.\n",
      "I know what it's like to lose the people you love. I know this is hard for you. But winter is coming. We know what's coming with it. We can't face it alone.\n",
      "No. Olly leaves. Jon sighs.\n",
      "You'll get them back, I swear it. Have a safe journey, Your Grace. And thank you. Jon watches Stannis walk away and get on his horse. He makes eye contact with Melisandre, but she looks away. Stannis and his army begin leaving.\n",
      "First Ranger, you have command of Castle Black.\n",
      "As always, thank you for your honesty. Jon walks away to Sam.\n",
      "Thank you, Sam.\n",
      "Me too. They hug. Jon gets on a horse next to Tormund and rides away. INT. CASTLE BLACK - MAESTOR AEMON’S ROOM\n",
      "Does that make me a fool?\n",
      "He’s not my prisoner.\n",
      "We’re allies. The Hardhome wildlings complain loudly.\n",
      "We’re not here to fight. We’re here to talk.\n",
      "My name’s Jon Snow. I’m Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch. We’re not friends. We’ve never been friends. We won’t become friends today. This isn’t about friendship. This is about survival. This is about putting a 700 foot wall between you and what’s out there.\n",
      "In normal times we wouldn’t. But these aren’t normal times. The white walkers don’t care if a man’s Free Folk or Crow. We’re all the same to them. Meat to their army. But together we can beat them.\n",
      "It’s not a trick. It’s a gift for those who join us. Karsi examine the glass in shock.\n",
      "Dragonglass. A man of the Night’s Watch used one of these daggers to kill a walker.\n",
      "No. But I trust the man.\n",
      "Come with me and I'll share these weapons.\n",
      "There are good lands south of the wall. The Night's Watch will allow you through the tunnel and allow your people to farm those lands. There is hesitation.\n",
      "I knew Mance Rayder. He never wanted a war with the Night’s Watch, he wanted a new life for his people. For you. We’re prepared to give you that new life.\n",
      "If you swear you join us when the real war begins.\n",
      "He died.\n",
      "I’m not asking you to forget your dead. I’ll never forget mine. I lost 50 brothers the night that Mance attacked the wall. But I’m asking you to think about your children now. They’ll never have children of their own if we don’t band together. The Long Night is coming and the dead come with it. No clan can stop them. The free folk can’t stop them. The Night’s Watch can’t stop them. And all the southern kings can’t stop them. Only together, all of us, and even then it might not be enough, but at least then we’ll give the fuckers a fight. There are small nods of approval throughout the room.\n",
      "How many are with us? 5000?\n",
      "We’re leaving too many behind.\n",
      "And he knew them better than I ever will.\n",
      "Get in line! Get in line! EXT. HARDHOME - GATE A wight tries to climb the gate. INT. HARDHOME - CABIN Wights crawl to the top of the cabin and jumps through the hole in the roof. The men prepare their weapons and the giant growls. EXT. HARDHOME - GATE One wight tries to climb under the gate. A barrage of arrows flies at the wights trying to get through the wall. Most of them land. The wight crawls even further under the gate. The wights start making holes in the gate. A sword sticks through the gate coming close to Loboda on the gate. Loboda dodges the sword, looks down to see the wight crawling under the gate, and stomps its head in. EXT. HARDHOME - SHORE The people continue to rush onto the boats with Jon, Tormund, and Karsi leading them.\n",
      "Hold the line! Hold the line!\n",
      "Get them to the ship and come back for me!\n",
      "Now! Karsi approaches Jon.\n",
      "You should be on one of those boats.\n",
      "You have my word. I’ve given orders.\n",
      "Night’s Watch with me! Move! Move! Move! Jon, Tormund, Karsi, and the Night’s Watch brothers charge from the shore to the gate. EXT. HARDHOME - SHORE The wights have knocked a hole into the gate big enough to crawl out of. One breaks through, tears someone apart, and then is taken down. A group of wights storm through the same hole. Cut to an overhead that shows just how many wights are behind the gate. Jon arrives at the gate. He pins a wight to the gate with Longclaw as Tormund and Karsi kill the wights that have already gotten through. The archers take out the wight Jon pinned to the gate, and then the men cover the hole the wights had been escaping from with a sled. Fighting continues. A group of wights tear into a Crow. Loboda and Karsi continue to kill the wights. Jon looks up through the mist and sees 4 White Walkers on horseback on the top of the cliff.\n",
      "The Dragonglass!\n",
      "The Dragonglass!\n",
      "Go! Go! Go!\n",
      "It was a failure.\n",
      "I went to save them, I failed.\n",
      "I don’t think that fact’s lost on them. Cut to many men of the Night’s Watch glaring at Jon, then Olly who exchanges a long look with Jon from the top of the stairs. Alliser walks down the steps to Jon.\n",
      "He raised his hands. And they all stood up at once. Tens of thousands of them, the biggest army in the world.\n",
      "I’m gonna hope they don’t learn how to climb the wall.\n",
      "With Longclaw. I saw them shatter steel axes like they were glass. But Longclaw…\n",
      "Not enough. (pause) The first Lord Commander in history to sacrifice the lives of sworn Brothers to save the lives of Wildlings. How’s it feel to be friends with the most hated man in Castle Black? (smiles)\n",
      "Here’s to us then. Long may they sneer. Jon and Sam clink glasses and drink. Sam looks to Jon.\n",
      "What?\n",
      "I need you here, Sam. If you leave, who’s left to give me advice I trust?\n",
      "You know that The Citadel will make you swear off women, too.\n",
      "Sam?\n",
      "Sam… Sam smiles.\n",
      "You’ve just been beaten half to death. How did you-- SAM (smiling): Very carefully. Jon smiles and lets out a small laugh.\n",
      "I’m glad the end of the world’s working out for someone. They sit in silence for a moment.\n",
      "We don’t have enough men to make any difference.\n",
      "The wildlings won’t ever fight for Stannis, I told you before--\n",
      "It’s not their fight! The gates to Castle Black are opened and Melisandre arrives, alone and on horseback. Jon and Davos rush over to her.\n",
      "Stannis? No response.\n",
      "He could be lying.\n",
      "Where is he?\n",
      "Olly… Olly stabs him.\n"
