# Genius Game of Thrones Scraper

This repo contains a simple jupyter notebook that scrapes information from the
[Genius](https://genius.com/) site for [Game of
Thrones](https://genius.com/artists/Game-of-thrones).  I'm posting the code here
because Genius tends to have some high quality labeled unstructured text.  It
may be useful for training data.
